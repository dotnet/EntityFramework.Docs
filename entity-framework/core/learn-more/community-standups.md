### May 15: [Harnessing the Power of Firebird in .NET](https://www.youtube.com/live/ouGIWUtzxRQ?si=qtZ1xqKjKe_E1MhI)

In this community talk, we delve into the integration of Firebird, an open-source SQL relational database management system, with .NET, a free, cross-platform, open-source developer platform. This session aims to provide an understanding of how these two powerful technologies can be combined to create robust, scalable, and efficient applications.

This talk is designed for developers of all levels interested in expanding their knowledge on database management and .NET development. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a beginner looking to broaden your skill set, this talk will provide valuable insights into the effective use of Firebird with .NET.

Join us for this enlightening session and discover how you can harness the power of Firebird in .NET to take your applications to the next level.

### Apr 17: [All about EF Core property mapping](https://www.youtube.com/live/ouGIWUtzxRQ?si=qtZ1xqKjKe_E1MhI)

In this episode, Arthur Vickers and Jiri Cincura from the EF team discuss everything about mapping properties in EF Core. We’ll look at:

- The differences between properties and navigations.
- How EF decides to map a property, and whether it is mapped to a nullable column, has a max length defined, etc.
- When backing fields are used, and mapping fields directly.
- Shadow properties.
- Indexer properties.

And if we get time, we’ll look at how value converters influence all this!

### Mar 20: [Building Distributed Applications with Hot Chocolate 14, Aspire, and Entity Framework](https://www.youtube.com/live/JjT9pg6oGsE?si=jFykuE06ZFeHGEDJ)

Building and debugging distributed systems challenges developers to balance complexity with the need for simplicity. Ideally, we aim for the simplicity of a monolith while benefiting from microservices' scalability and isolation. In todays meetup we will have an early look at what we are doing with Hot Chocolate 14 to integrate well with Aspire and bridge this gap, offering an approach that combines microservices' advantages with the ease of a monolith for our consumers. Also we will have a look at a lot of the new feature around Hot Chocolate 14 that will make it so much easier to build layered services with entity framework. Do not worry! We will start slow with just the simplest of services accessing a database and then go all the way in.

### Mar 6: [EF Core keys and value generation](https://www.youtube.com/live/_eNPkrTuLvE?si=RuZUFoLqF2QnwbvF)

In this episode, Arthur and members of the EF Team will explore generated property values and how value generation interacts with keys in the model. We will look at fully client-side value generation, as well as how to use identity columns, database sequences, or a hi-lo pattern for server-side generation. In addition, we’ll investigate how generated key values impact EF Core change tracking by determining if an entity will go into the `Added` state or not. And finally, if we have time, we’ll look at special considerations for TPC mapping, and customizations such as setting before and after save behaviors, and sentinel values.

### February 21: [Window and binary functions using Zomp EF Core extensions](https://www.youtube.com/live/Z9SkvUuU9Sc?si=xX3rRG3Xr3R9Zj5o)

Window functions are one of the most powerful features of SQL. Did you know that you can use Window Functions in EF Core today instead of writing raw SQL? Victor Irzak joins Shay and Arthur to explore real use cases of window functions with EF Core.

### February 7: [Database concurrency and EF Core: Beyond optimistic concurrency](https://www.youtube.com/live/0eVTR5up2RY?si=pttR5NJ85_NWozhj)

In the 3rd installment of our series on concurrency, we'll dive deep into SQL isolation levels, how they work (and work differently!) across SQL Server and PostgreSQL. We'll hopefully learn a bit about how database locks, snapshots and isolation levels work together to bring some sanity into the world of concurrency.

### January 24: [Database concurrency and EF Core: ASP.NET and Blazor](https://www.youtube.com/live/xVyYrtetDeA?si=Bx2s44mk_ayUnAzx)

In the last episode, we dug deep into the underpinnings of optimistic concurrency handling in EF Core. In this episode, we continue that journey to cover disconnected scenarios. That is, where the entity travels to a client and then back to the server before being updated in the database. We’ll look at the different patterns for doing updates like this in ASP.NET Core and Blazor apps and see how concurrency tokens work with each of these. We’ll also look at how `ExecuteUpdate` can be used with concurrency tokens, and take a look at ETag concurrency in Azure Cosmos DB.

### January 10: [Database concurrency and EF Core](https://www.youtube.com/live/YfIM-gfJe4c?si=ZQNxpGEULZt3L43I)

What happens when one user is reading a record while another user is updating it? What if both users try to update the same record at the same time? In this episode of the .NET Data Community Standup, Shay and Arthur take a look at how different database isolation levels impact concurrency and performance, and then extend this to optimistic concurrency patterns supported by Entity Framework Core. This includes both manual concurrency tokens and automatic concurrency tokens like SQL Server’s “rowversion”. We’ll also dig into what happens in disconnected scenarios, and when to use the original value as opposed to the current value of the concurrency token. Finally, we’ll look at how EF Core handles optimistic concurrency with ETags when using a document database like Azure Cosmos DB.

### October 18: [Introducing the MongoDB provider for EF Core](https://www.youtube.com/live/Zat-ferrjro?si=UKIgjsB5RpnEqJUo)

In this episode of the .NET Data Community Standup, we talk to the engineers from MongoDB who have just released the first preview of an official EF Core provider. The EF team has collaborated closely with MongoDB on this provider, which now joins the Cosmos provider as flagship document database providers for EF Core. We will demo the provider, talk about what it can and cannot do, and of course answer all your questions!

### October 4: [Size doesn't matter: Smaller features in EF8](https://www.youtube.com/live/GGDv_p4LAL8?si=WfswHDLiYnMMe4Hm)

In addition to the big features such as primitive collections and complex types, EF8 contains many smaller features and minor improvements. In this session, Arthur and Shay from the EF team will take a look at a few of these smaller features, including:

- Sentinels to control when the database generates a value
- Massive performance improvements for IN and EXISTS in LINQ queries
- DateOnly/TimeOnly on SQL Server
- Raw SQL queries for unmapped types
- More flexible ExecuteUpdate
- Numeric SQL rowversion properties
- Cleaner SQL through parentheses elimination

### September 20: [Complex types as value objects in EF8](https://www.youtube.com/live/H-soJYqWSds?si=tJzm-uqLL0ZJnsUh)

The Entity Framework team returns with new community standups after a summer break heads-down working on EF8. In this session, we’ll look at the new “complex types” feature in EF8. Complex types do not have a key or any identity outside of the object’s value, but can still be deconstructed by property to map to different columns in the database. This allows either reference or value types to be used as DDD value objects with much better fidelity than when owned types are used. We’ll show examples of using complex types and talk about and answer your questions on the behavioral differences between entity types, owned entity types, complex types, and primitive types.

### June 14: [Synchronizing data between the cloud and the client (using SQLite)](https://www.youtube.com/live/QTvFiiST-r4?si=9SOUVhwz75VplWad)

In this session, we'll invite Eric Sink to discuss a solution for keeping a synchronized copy of the DB (using SQLite) on the client, rather than asking data for the cloud every time. This is helpful for mobile scenarios where the connectivity may be poor, but the "rep and sync" approach can reduce the time the user spends waiting on the network.  Local writes are fast, sync happens in the background. We'll explore how this can be done efficiently, how to deal with conflict resolution, and other data sync-related concerns.

### May 17: [Collections of primitive values in EF Core](https://www.youtube.com/live/AUS2OZjsA2I?si=V8hR14VyBtHuvbmp)

In this episode of the .NET Data Community Standup, the .NET Data Access team dive into new support for collections of primitive values, just released in EF Core 8 Preview 4. Collections of a primitive type can now be used as properties of an entity type and will be mapped to a JSON column in the relational database. In addition, parameters of primitive values can be passed to the database. In either case, the native JSON processing capabilities of the database are then used to exact and manipulate the primitive values, just as if they were in a table. This opens up powerful query possibilities, as well as optimizations to common problems such as translating queries that use Contains.

### Apr 19: [EF Core Internals – Model Building](https://www.youtube.com/live/FYz0rAxQkC8?si=GsLuBBByuQbMurYP)

In this session, the .NET Data Access team will dig into the EF Core internals for building a model. EF models are built using a combination of three mechanisms: conventions, mapping attributes, and the model builder API. We will explain each of these mechanisms and show how they interact. We’ll also cover how models are cached, and ways in which that caching can be controlled. And, as always, we’ll answer your questions live!

### Mar 22: [Using hierarchical data in SQL Server and PostgreSQL with EF Core](https://www.youtube.com/live/pmnHGWYpCfg?si=h_v40tZ7NEw_wZ6W)

Join the .NET Data Access Team to learn about mapping hierarchical data structures to relational databases using EF Core. We’ll look at “hierarchyid” on SQL Server/Azure SQL and “ltree” on PostgresSQL, and show how to map tree structures such as a family tree, file system, or organization structure. EF Core can then be used to write LINQ queries against the hierarchy to find ancestors and descendants in various ways, as well as perform manipulation of subtrees for updates. And, as always, we’ll be here to answer your questions!

### Nov 7: [EF7 Custom Model Conventions](https://www.youtube.com/live/6apfe1L1FhY?si=g6NuYVtFmLCy9a6i)

EF Core uses a metadata "model" to describe how the application's entity types are mapped to the underlying database. This model is built using a set of around 60 "conventions". The model built by conventions can then be customized using mapping attributes (aka "data annotations") and/or calls to the DbModelBuilder API in OnModelCreating. EF7 allows applications to remove or modify existing conventions, as well as create new conventions. Join us for this .NET Data Community Standup to learn how to take advantage of custom model building conventions in your EF Core 7.0 applications.

### Oct 19: [New EF Core 7.0 APIs (Bulk Update)](https://www.youtube.com/live/rrKhbiXydKs?si=S5nUIdSerRg8Vqtp)

EF Core 7.0 introduces the ExecuteUpdate and ExecuteDelete APIs, which allow you to easily use LINQ to express a database update or delete operation. These APIs can be far more efficient for applying changes to multiple rows based on a condition, e.g. “delete rows which have InActive set to true” (AKA bulk update scenarios). But in some scenarios, they also allow you to express changes over a single row in a much more succinct and simple way, simplifying your code. ExecuteUpdate and ExecuteDelete completely bypass EF’s change tracking and execute immediately, as opposed to when SaveChanges is called. Tune in to learn more and to explore the new possibilities that these new APIs bring!

JSON columns allow relational databases to directly store documents while retaining the overall relational structure of the data. EF7 contains provider-agnostic support for JSON columns, with an implementation for SQL Server.  The JSON in these columns can queried using LINQ, allowing filtering and sorting by the elements of the documents, as well as projection of elements out of the documents into results. In addition, EF7 supports element-level change tracking of the documents and partial updates for only the changed elements when SaveChanges is called.

Aggregate functions such as COUNT, MAX or AVG compute a single value from multiple rows. EF7 adds support for custom provider aggregate functions, adding support for many new translations. In this episode of the .NET Data Community Standup, we’ll explore these new translations across different EF providers, and see what they could mean for more efficient data loading from the database. We’ll also go into some tricky design problems and under the hood query translation details which the team discussed while working on this feature.

### Jul 27: [DbDataSource, a new System.Data abstraction](https://www.youtube.com/live/vRUtHeUpU44?si=jm73JkMidEcZHJZj)

In this episode of the .NET data community standup, we'll explore DbDataSource, a new abstraction being introduced to System.Data in .NET 7.0. DbDataSource unlocks easier integration of ADO.NET drivers with dependency injection, better management of advanced driver configuration, helps performance and more. Tune in to see improvements at the lower levels of the .NET data stack.

### Jul 13: [Intercept this EF7 Preview 6 Event](https://www.youtube.com/live/EJs3sSetr2Q?si=V-NxDGrPLPAsV-3f)

EF7 includes a variety of new interceptors and events, as well as many improvements to the existing lifecycle hooks. In this session, Arthur and others from the .NET Data team will dive into this new functionality, including examples for intercepting materialization of entities, query expression trees, identity resolution when tracking, and optimistic concurrency violations. Join us for a fun-packed ride into the world of modifying EF behavior through interception with code galore!

### Jun 29: [DbContext Configuration and Lifetime - EF Core Architecture Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/live/NPgFlqXPbK8?si=k1HbnuniXaivGlAS)

Arthur and others from the EF Team continue their deep dive into the architecture of Entity Framework Core. This is a code-driven discussion looking at how and why things are designed and implemented the way they are. In this session, we look at the initialization and configuration of a DbContext instance, including selection of the provider, creating DbSet instances, reading DbContextOptions, and DbContext pooling.

### Jun 15: [TPH, TPT, and TPC Inheritance mapping with EF Core](https://www.youtube.com/live/HaL6DKW1mrg?si=s82taQNe2QUlZHOA)

Type inheritance hierarchies as used in object-oriented programming do not map naturally to relational database schemas. In this live stream, we will look at different strategies for inheritance mapping when using EF Core with a relational database. This includes table-per-hierarchy (TPH) mapping, table-per-type (TPT) mapping, and table-per-concrete type (TPC) mapping, which is new in EF Core 7.0 preview 5. We will look at the consequences of the mapping on the generated SQL and consider the performance and storage implications. This will result in some guidance as to when each strategy should be used.

### Jun 1: [EF Core Architecture: Internal Dependency Injection](https://www.youtube.com/live/pYhe-Mt0HzI?si=SF8S0NSQnpTS4zBO)

Join Arthur Vickers and others from the EF Team as we start a deep dive into the architecture of Entity Framework Core. This won’t be a formal talk, but rather a free-form discussion driven by the code where we look how and why things are designed and implemented the way they are. This week, we’ll start with the use of dependency injection (D.I.) and the “internal service provider.” This is the backbone of how EF Core works as a service-oriented architecture, where the core code, database providers, and plugins all implement services that work together to provide EF’s functionality.

### Jun 2: [Introducing EF Core Compiled Models](https://www.youtube.com/live/XdhX3iLXAPk?si=DzUmXMMLWFh8XSXv)

EF Core creates an internal model for entity types and their database mappings. This model is typically built once when the application starts. Starting with EF Core 6.0, it is now possible to instead build this model at compile time. This can reduce startup time by up to 67% for large models. Join us for this Community Standup, where the team will introduce compiled models and demo their use.

### Feb 10: [Typed Exceptions for Entity Framework Core](https://www.youtube.com/live/aUl5QfswNU4?si=zbglNkNEElISaVpb)

When using Entity Framework Core for data access all database exceptions are wrapped in DbUpdateException. If you need to know whether the exception was caused by a unique constraint, the value being too long, or the value missing for a required column, you need to dig into the concrete DbException subclass instance and check the error number to determine the exact cause. In this episode, learn how EntityFramework.Exceptions handles all the database-specific details and allows you to use typed exceptions for Entity Framework Core when your query violates database constraints.
