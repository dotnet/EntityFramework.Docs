# EF Core Tools & Extensions: Detached.EntityFramework

> [!NOTE] This extension is not maintained as part of the Entity Framework Core project. When considering a third party extension, be sure to evaluate quality, licensing, support, etc. to ensure they meet your requirements.

Loads and saves entire detached entity graphs (the entity with their child entities and lists). Inspired by [GraphDiff](https://github.com/refactorthis/GraphDiff/). The idea is also add some plugins to simplificate some repetitive tasks, like auditing and pagination.

The following resource will help you get started with Detached.EntityFramework
