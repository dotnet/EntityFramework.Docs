# EF Core Tools & Extensions

Tools and extensions provide additional functionality for Entity Framework Core.

Extensions are built by a variety of sources. Not all extensions are maintained as part of the Entity Framework Core project. When considering a third party extension, be sure to evaluate quality, licensing, support, etc. to ensure they meet your requirements.
