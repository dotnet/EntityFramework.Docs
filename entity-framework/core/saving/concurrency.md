# Handling Concurrency Conflicts

> [!NOTE]
> This page documents how concurrency works in EF Core and how to handle concurrency conflicts in your application. See [Concurrency Tokens](xref:core/modeling/concurrency) for details on how to configure concurrency tokens in your model.

_Database concurrency_ refers to situations in which multiple processes or users access or change the same data in a database at the same time. _Concurrency control_ refers to specific mechanisms used to ensure data consistency in presence of concurrent changes.

EF Core implements _optimistic concurrency control_, meaning that it will let multiple processes or users make changes independently without the overhead of synchronization or locking. In the ideal situation, these changes will not interfere with each other and therefore will be able to succeed. In the worst case scenario, two or more processes will attempt to make conflicting changes, and only one of them should succeed.

## How concurrency control works in EF Core

Properties configured as concurrency tokens are used to implement optimistic concurrency control: whenever an update or delete operation is performed during `SaveChanges`, the value of the concurrency token on the database is compared against the original value read by EF Core.

- If the values match, the operation can complete.
- If the values do not match, EF Core assumes that another user has performed a conflicting operation and aborts the current transaction.

The situation when another user has performed an operation that conflicts with the current operation is known as _concurrency conflict_.

Database providers are responsible for implementing the comparison of concurrency token values.

On relational databases EF Core includes a check for the value of the concurrency token in the `WHERE` clause of any `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statements. After executing the statements, EF Core reads the number of rows that were affected.

If no rows are affected, a concurrency conflict is detected, and EF Core throws `DbUpdateConcurrencyException`.

For example, we may want to configure `LastName` on `Person` to be a concurrency token. Then any update operation on Person will include the concurrency check in the `WHERE` clause:

```sql
UPDATE [Person] SET [FirstName] = @p1
WHERE [PersonId] = @p0 AND [LastName] = @p2;
```

## Resolving concurrency conflicts

Continuing with the previous example, if one user tries to save some changes to a `Person`, but another user has already changed the `LastName`, then an exception will be thrown.

At this point, the application could simply inform the user that the update was not successful due to conflicting changes and move on. But it may be desirable to prompt the user to ensure this record still represents the same actual person and to retry the operation.

This process is an example of _resolving a concurrency conflict_.

Resolving a concurrency conflict involves merging the pending changes from the current `DbContext` with the values in the database. What values get merged will vary based on the application and may be directed by user input.

**There are three sets of values available to help resolve a concurrency conflict:**

- **Current values** are the values that the application was attempting to write to the database.
- **Original values** are the values that were originally retrieved from the database, before any edits were made.
- **Database values** are the values currently stored in the database.

The general approach to handle a concurrency conflicts is:

1. Catch `DbUpdateConcurrencyException` during `SaveChanges`.
2. Use `DbUpdateConcurrencyException.Entries` to prepare a new set of changes for the affected entities.
3. Refresh the original values of the concurrency token to reflect the current values in the database.
4. Retry the process until no conflicts occur.

In the following example, `Person.FirstName` and `Person.LastName` are set up as concurrency tokens. There is a `// TODO:` comment in the location where you include application specific logic to choose the value to be saved.
