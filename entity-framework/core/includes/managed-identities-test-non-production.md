> This article uses a local database that doesn't require the user to be authenticated. Production apps should use the most secure authentication flow available. For more information on authentication for deployed test and production apps, see [Secure authentication flows](xref:/aspnet/core/security/?view=aspnetcore-8.0#secure-authentication-flows).
