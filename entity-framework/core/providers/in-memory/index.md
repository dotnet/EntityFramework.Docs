# EF Core In-Memory Database Provider

This database provider allows Entity Framework Core to be used with an in-memory database. While some users use the in-memory database for testing, this is discouraged. For more information on how to test EF Core applications, see the [_Testing EF Core Applications_](xref:core/testing/index). The provider is maintained by Microsoft as part of the [Entity Framework Core Project](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore).

> [!WARNING]
> The EF Core in-memory database is not designed for performance or robustness and should not be used outside of testing environments. It is not designed for production use.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> New features are not being added to the in-memory database.

## Install

Install the [Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory NuGet package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory/).
