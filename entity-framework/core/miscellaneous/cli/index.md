# Command Line Reference

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is for EF Core. For EF6.x, see [Entity Framework 6](../../../ef6/index.md).

Entity Framework provides command line tooling to automate common tasks such as code generation and database migrations. There are two primary command line experiences that EF Core provides.
* [Package Manager Console](powershell.md) commands provides command line tools integrated into Visual Studio.
* [.NET Core CLI](dotnet.md) commands provide IDE-independent and cross-platform tools for applications being developed with .NET Core.
