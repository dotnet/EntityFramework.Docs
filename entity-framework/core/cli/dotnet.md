# Entity Framework Core tools reference - .NET Core CLI

The command-line interface (CLI) tools for Entity Framework Core perform design-time development tasks. For example, they create [migrations](/aspnet/core/data/ef-mvc/migrations), apply migrations, and generate code for a model based on an existing database. The commands are an extension to the cross-platform [dotnet](/dotnet/core/tools) command, which is part of the [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core). These tools work with .NET Core projects.

When using Visual Studio, consider using the [Package Manager Console tools](xref:core/cli/powershell) instead of the CLI tools. Package Manager Console tools automatically:

* Works with the current project selected in the **Package Manager Console** without requiring that you manually switch directories.
* Opens files generated by a command after the command is completed.
* Provides tab completion of commands, parameters, project names, context types, and migration names.

## Installing the tools

`dotnet ef` can be installed as either a global or local tool. Most developers prefer installing `dotnet ef` as a global tool using the following command:

```dotnetcli
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
```

To use it as a local tool, restore the dependencies of a project that declares it as a tooling dependency using a [tool manifest file](/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools#install-a-local-tool).

Update the tool using the following command:

```dotnetcli
dotnet tool update --global dotnet-ef
```

Before you can use the tools on a specific project, you'll need to add the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design` package to it.

```dotnetcli
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
```

### Verify installation

Run the following commands to verify that EF Core CLI tools are correctly installed:

  ```dotnetcli
  dotnet ef
  ```

The output from the command identifies the version of the tools in use:

```output

                     _/\__
               ---==/    \\
         ___  ___   |.    \|\
        | __|| __|  |  )   \\\
        | _| | _|   \_/ |  //|\\
        |___||_|       /   \\\/\\

Entity Framework Core .NET Command-line Tools 2.1.3-rtm-32065

<Usage documentation follows, not shown.>
```

## Update the tools

Use `dotnet tool update --global dotnet-ef` to update the global tools to the latest available version. If you have the tools installed locally in your project use `dotnet tool update dotnet-ef`. Install a specific version by appending `--version <VERSION>` to your command. See the [Update](/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-tool-update) section of the dotnet tool documentation for more details.

## Using the tools

Before using the tools, you might have to create a startup project or set the environment.

### Target project and startup project

The commands refer to a *project* and a *startup project*.

* The *project* is also known as the *target project* because it's where the commands add or remove files. By default, the project in the current directory is the target project. You can specify a different project as target project by using the <nobr>`--project`</nobr> option.

* The *startup project* is the one that the tools build and run. The tools have to execute application code at design time to get information about the project, such as the database connection string and the configuration of the model. By default, the project in the current directory is the startup project. You can specify a different project as startup project by using the <nobr>`--startup-project`</nobr> option.

The startup project and target project are often the same project. A typical scenario where they are separate projects is when:

* The EF Core context and entity classes are in a .NET Core class library.
* A .NET Core console app or web app references the class library.

It's also possible to [put migrations code in a class library separate from the EF Core context](xref:core/managing-schemas/migrations/projects).

### Other target frameworks

The CLI tools work with .NET Core projects and .NET Framework projects. Apps that have the EF Core model in a .NET Standard class library might not have a .NET Core or .NET Framework project. For example, this is true of Xamarin and Universal Windows Platform apps. In such cases, you can create a .NET Core console app project whose only purpose is to act as startup project for the tools. The project can be a dummy project with no real code &mdash; it is only needed to provide a target for the tooling.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Xamarin.Android, Xamarin.iOS, Xamarin.Mac are now integrated directly into .NET (starting with .NET 6) as .NET for Android, .NET for iOS, and .NET for macOS. If you're building with these project types today, they should be upgraded to .NET SDK-style projects for continued support. For more information about upgrading Xamarin projects to .NET, see the [Upgrade from Xamarin to .NET & .NET MAUI](/dotnet/maui/migration) documentation.

Why is a dummy project required? As mentioned earlier, the tools have to execute application code at design time. To do that, they need to use the .NET Core runtime. When the EF Core model is in a project that targets .NET Core or .NET Framework, the EF Core tools borrow the runtime from the project. They can't do that if the EF Core model is in a .NET Standard class library. The .NET Standard is not an actual .NET implementation; it's a specification of a set of APIs that .NET implementations must support. Therefore .NET Standard is not sufficient for the EF Core tools to execute application code. The dummy project you create to use as startup project provides a concrete target platform into which the tools can load the .NET Standard class library.

### ASP.NET Core environment

You can specify [the environment](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/environments) for ASP.NET Core projects on the command-line. This and any additional arguments are passed into Program.CreateHostBuilder.

```dotnetcli
dotnet ef database update -- --environment Production
```

> [!TIP]
> The `--` token directs `dotnet ef` to treat everything that follows as an argument and not try to parse them as options. Any extra arguments not used by `dotnet ef` are forwarded to the app.

> [!NOTE]
> NativeAOT support and precompiled queries are considered experimental in EF 9 and could change dramatically in the next release.

The [common options](#common-options) are listed above.

The following example uses the default settings and works if there is only one `DbContext` in the project:

```dotnetcli
dotnet ef dbcontext optimize
```

The following example optimizes the model for the context with the specified name and places it in a separate folder and namespace:

```dotnetcli
dotnet ef dbcontext optimize -o Models -n BlogModels -c BlogContext
```

## `dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold`

Generates code for a `DbContext` and entity types for a database. In order for this command to generate an entity type, the database table must have a primary key.

The [common options](#common-options) are listed above.

The following example scaffolds all schemas and tables and puts the new files in the *Models* folder.

```dotnetcli
dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold "Server=(localdb)\mssqllocaldb;Database=Blogging;Trusted_Connection=True;" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -o Models
```

The following example scaffolds only selected tables and creates the context in a separate folder with a specified name and namespace:

```dotnetcli
dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold "Server=(localdb)\mssqllocaldb;Database=Blogging;Trusted_Connection=True;" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer -o Models -t Blog -t Post --context-dir Context -c BlogContext --context-namespace New.Namespace
```

The following example reads the connection string from the project's configuration set using the [Secret Manager tool](/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets#secret-manager).

```dotnetcli
dotnet user-secrets set ConnectionStrings:Blogging "Data Source=(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB;Initial Catalog=Blogging"
dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold Name=ConnectionStrings:Blogging Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
```

The following example skips scaffolding an `OnConfiguring` method. This can be useful when you want to configure the DbContext outside of the class. For example, ASP.NET Core apps typically configure it in Startup.ConfigureServices.

```dotnetcli
dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold "Server=(localdb)\mssqllocaldb;Database=Blogging;User Id=myUsername;Password=myPassword;" Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer --no-onconfiguring
```
