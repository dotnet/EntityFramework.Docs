# Design-time DbContext Creation

Some of the EF Core Tools commands (for example, the [Migrations][1] commands) require a derived `DbContext` instance to be created at design time in order to gather details about the application's entity types and how they map to a database schema. In most cases, it is desirable that the `DbContext` thereby created is configured in a similar way to how it would be [configured at run time][2].

There are various ways the tools try to create the `DbContext`:

## From application services

If your startup project uses the [ASP.NET Core Web Host][3] or [.NET Core Generic Host][4], the tools try to obtain the DbContext object from the application's service provider.

The tools first try to obtain the service provider by invoking `Program.CreateHostBuilder()`, calling `Build()`, then accessing the `Services` property.

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/CommandLine/ApplicationService.cs#ApplicationService)]

> [!NOTE]
> When you create a new ASP.NET Core application, this hook is included by default.

The `DbContext` itself and any dependencies in its constructor need to be registered as services in the application's service provider. This can be easily achieved by having [a constructor on the `DbContext` that takes an instance of `DbContextOptions<TContext>` as an argument][5] and using the [`AddDbContext<TContext>` method][6].

## Using a constructor with no parameters

If the DbContext can't be obtained from the application service provider, the tools look for the derived `DbContext` type inside the project. Then they try to create an instance using a constructor with no parameters. This can be the default constructor if the `DbContext` is configured using the [`OnConfiguring`][7] method.

## From a design-time factory

You can also tell the tools how to create your DbContext by implementing the <xref:Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design.IDesignTimeDbContextFactory%601?displayProperty=nameWithType> interface: If a class implementing this interface is found in either the same project as the derived `DbContext` or in the application's startup project, the tools bypass the other ways of creating the DbContext and use the design-time factory instead.

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/CommandLine/BloggingContextFactory.cs#BloggingContextFactory)]

A design-time factory can be especially useful if you need to configure the `DbContext` differently for design time than at run time, if the `DbContext` constructor takes additional parameters are not registered in DI, if you are not using DI at all, or if for some reason you prefer not to have a `CreateHostBuilder` method in your ASP.NET Core application's `Main` class.

## Args

Both <xref:Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design.IDesignTimeDbContextFactory%601.CreateDbContext%2A?displayProperty=nameWithType> and `Program.CreateHostBuilder` accept command line arguments.

You can specify these arguments from the tools:

### [.NET Core CLI](#tab/dotnet-core-cli)

```dotnetcli
dotnet ef database update -- --environment Production
```

The `--` token directs `dotnet ef` to treat everything that follows as an argument and not try to parse them as options. Any extra arguments not used by `dotnet ef` are forwarded to the app.

### [Visual Studio](#tab/vs)

```powershell
Update-Database -Args '--environment Production'
```
