See [supported platforms](xref:core/miscellaneous/platforms) for information about the specific platforms supported by each EF Core release.

Entity Framework Core releases and support are aligned with .NET releases and support. See the [.NET support policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core) for information on support expiration and long-term support (LTS) releases.

\* EF Core 2.1 will continue to be supported when used with ASP.NET Core 2.1 on .NET Framework only. See [ASP.NET Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/aspnet) for details.

## Guidance on updating to new releases

* Supported releases are patched for security and other critical bugs. Always use the latest patch of a given release. For example, for EF Core 2.1, use 2.1.x for the highest 'x' available.
* Major version updates (for example, from EF Core 2 to EF Core 3) often have breaking changes. Thorough testing is advised when updating across major versions. Use the breaking changes links above for guidance on dealing with breaking changes.
* Minor version updates do not typically contain breaking changes. However, thorough testing is still advised since new features can introduce regressions.

## Release planning and schedules

EF Core releases align with the [.NET Core shipping schedule](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/roadmap.md).

Patch releases usually ship monthly, but have a long lead time.

See the [release planning process](xref:core/what-is-new/release-planning) for more information on how we decide what to ship in each release. We typically don't do detailed planning for further out than the next major or minor release.

## EF Core 9.0

The next planned stable release is **EF Core 9.0**, or just **EF9**, scheduled for **November 2024**.

See the [high-level plan for EF9](xref:core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/plan) for more information.
