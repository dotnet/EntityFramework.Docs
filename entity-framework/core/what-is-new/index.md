See [supported platforms](xref:core/miscellaneous/platforms) for information about the specific platforms supported by each EF Core release.

See the [.NET support policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core) for information on support expiration and long-term support (LTS) releases.

\* EF Core 2.1 will continue to be supported when used with ASP.NET Core 2.1 on .NET Framework only. See [ASP.NET Support Policy](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/aspnet) for details.

## Guidance on updating to new releases

* Supported releases are patched for security and other critical bugs. Always use the latest patch of a given release. For example, for EF Core 2.1, use 2.1.x for the highest 'x' available.
* Major version updates (for example, from EF Core 2 to EF Core 3) often have breaking changes. Thorough testing is advised when updating across major versions. Use the breaking changes links above for guidance on dealing with breaking changes.
* Minor version updates do not typically contain breaking changes. However, thorough testing is still advised since new features can introduce regressions.

## Release planning and schedules

EF Core releases align with the [.NET Core shipping schedule](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/roadmap.md).

Patch releases usually ship monthly, but have a long lead time. We are working to improve this.

See the [release planning process](xref:core/what-is-new/release-planning) for more information on how we decide what to ship in each release. We typically don't do detailed planning for further out than the next major or minor release.

## EF Core 6.0

The next planned stable release is **EF Core 6.0**, scheduled for **November 2021**.

A [high-level plan for EF Core 6.0](xref:core/what-is-new/ef-core-6.0/plan) has been created by following the documented [release planning process](xref:core/what-is-new/release-planning).

Your feedback on planning is important. The best way to indicate the importance of an issue is to vote (thumbs-up üëç) for that issue on GitHub. This data will then feed into the planning process for the next release.

### Get it now

EF Core 6.0 packages are **available now** as

* [Daily builds](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/master/docs/DailyBuilds.md)
  * All the latest features and bug fixes. Generally very stable; 75,000+ tests run against each build.
* [Previews on NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore/6.0.0-preview.3.21201.2)

Note that the previews lag behind daily builds, but are tested to work with the corresponding ASP.NET Core and .NET Core previews.

Using the previews or daily builds is a great way to find issues and provide feedback as early as possible. The sooner we get such feedback, the more likely it will be actionable before the next official release.
