# What's New in EF Core 11

EF Core 11.0 (EF11) is the next release after EF Core 10.0 and is currently in development.

> [!TIP]
> You can run and debug into the samples by [downloading the sample code from GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/EntityFramework.Docs). Each section below links to the source code specific to that section.

EF11 requires the .NET 11 SDK to build and requires the .NET 11 runtime to run. EF11 will not run on earlier .NET versions, and will not run on .NET Framework.
