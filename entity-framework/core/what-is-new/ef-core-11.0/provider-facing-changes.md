# Provider-facing changes in EF Core 11 (EF11)

This page documents noteworthy changes in EF Core 11 which may affect EF providers; none of these should affect end-users of EF - this page is only meant for EF provider maintainers. The list is maintained on a best-effort basis, some changes may be missing.

## Test changes

* The inheritance specification tests have been reorganized into a folder of their own ([PR](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/37410)).
