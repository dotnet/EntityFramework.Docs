# What's New in EF Core 10

EF Core 10 (EF10) is the next release after EF Core 9 and is scheduled for release in November 2025.

EF10 is available as a preview. See [.NET 10 release notes](https://github.com/dotnet/core/release-notes/10.0) to get information about the latest preview. This article will be updated as new preview releases are made available.

> [!TIP]
> You can run and debug into the samples by [downloading the sample code from GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/EntityFramework.Docs). Each section below links to the source code specific to that section.

EF10 requires the .NET 10 SDK to build and requires the .NET 10 runtime to run. EF10 will not run on earlier .NET versions, and will not run on .NET Framework.

> [!TIP]
> The _What's New_ docs are updated for each preview. All the samples are set up to use the [EF10 daily builds](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/main/docs/DailyBuilds.md), which usually have several additional weeks of completed work compared to the latest preview. We strongly encourage use of the daily builds when testing new features so that you're not doing your testing against stale bits.

## LINQ and SQL translation

### Support for the .NET 10 LeftJoin operator

`LEFT JOIN` is a common and useful operation when working with EF Core. In previous versions, implementing `LEFT JOIN` in LINQ was quite complicated, requiring `SelectMany`, `GroupJoin` and `DefaultIfEmpty` operations [in a particular configuration](/dotnet/csharp/linq/standard-query-operators/join-operations#perform-left-outer-joins).

.NET 10 adds first-class LINQ support for `LeftJoin` method, making those queries much simpler to write. EF Core recognizes the new method, so it can be used in EF LINQ queries instead of the old construct:

```C#
var query = context.Students
    .LeftJoin(
        context.Departments,
        student => student.DepartmentID,
        department => department.ID,
        (student, department) => new 
        { 
            student.FirstName,
            student.LastName,
            Department = department.Name ?? "[NONE]"
        });
```

See [#12793](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/12793) for more details.

### Other query improvements

* Translation for DateOnly.ToDateTime(timeOnly) ([#35194](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/35194), contributed by [@mseada94](https://github.com/mseada94)).
* Optimization for multiple consecutive `LIMIT`s ([#35384](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/35384), contributed by [@ranma42](https://github.com/ranma42)).
* Optimization for use of `Count` operation on `ICollection<T>` ([#35381](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/35381), contributed by [@ChrisJollyAU](https://github.com/ChrisJollyAU)).
* Optimization for `MIN`/`MAX` over `DISTINCT` ([#34699](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/34699), contributed by [@ranma42](https://github.com/ranma42)).
* Translation for date/time functions using `DatePart.Microsecond` and `DatePart.Nanosecond` arguments ([#34861](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/34861)).
* Simplifying parameter names (e.g. from `@__city_0` to `city`) ([#35200](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/pull/35200)).

## ExecuteUpdateAsync now accepts a regular, non-expression lambda

The <xref:Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.RelationalQueryableExtensions.ExecuteUpdateAsync*> can be used to express arbitrary update operations in the database. In previous versions, the changes to be performed on the database rows were provided via an expression tree parameter; this made it quite difficult to build those changes dynamically. For example, let's assume we want to update a Blog's Views, but conditionally also its Name. Since the setters argument was an expression tree, code such as the following needed to be written:

```c#
// Base setters - update the Views only
Expression<Func<SetPropertyCalls<Blog>, SetPropertyCalls<Blog>>> setters =
    s => s.SetProperty(b => b.Views, 8);

// Conditionally add SetProperty(b => b.Name, "foo") to setters, based on the value of nameChanged
if (nameChanged)
{
    var blogParameter = Expression.Parameter(typeof(Blog), "b");

    setters = Expression.Lambda<Func<SetPropertyCalls<Blog>, SetPropertyCalls<Blog>>>(
        Expression.Call(
            instance: setters.Body,
            methodName: nameof(SetPropertyCalls<Blog>.SetProperty),
            typeArguments: [typeof(string)],
            arguments:
            [
                Expression.Lambda<Func<Blog, string>>(Expression.Property(blogParameter, nameof(Blog.Name)), blogParameter),
                Expression.Constant("foo")
            ]),
        setters.Parameters);
}

await context.Blogs.ExecuteUpdateAsync(setters);
```

Manually creating expression trees is complicated and error-prone, and made this common scenario much more difficult than it should have been. Starting with EF 10, you can now write the following instead:

```c#
await context.Blogs.ExecuteUpdateAsync(s =>
{
    s.SetProperty(b => b.Views, 8);
    if (nameChanged)
    {
        s.SetProperty(b => b.Name, "foo");
    }
});
```
