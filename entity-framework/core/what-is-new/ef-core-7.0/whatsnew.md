# What's New in EF Core 7.0

EF Core 7.0 (EF7) is the next release after EF Core 6.0 and is scheduled for release in November 2022. See [_Plan for Entity Framework Core 7.0_](xref:core/what-is-new/ef-core-7.0/plan) for details and [_.NET Data Biweekly Updates (2022)_](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/27185) for progress on the plan.

EF7 is currently in preview. The latest release on NuGet is [EF Core 7.0 Preview 7](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore/7.0.0-preview.7.22376.2).

EF7 is also available as [daily builds](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/main/docs/DailyBuilds.md) which contain all the latest EF7 features and API tweaks. The samples here make use of these daily builds.

> [!TIP]
> You can run and debug into the samples by [downloading the sample code from GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/EntityFramework.Docs). Each section links to the source code specific to that section.

EF7 targets .NET 6, and so can be used with either [.NET 6 (LTS)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0) or [.NET 7](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0).

## Sample model

Many of the examples below use a simple model with blogs, posts, tags, and authors:

[!code-csharp[BlogsModel](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/BlogsContext.cs?name=BlogsModel)]

Some of the examples also use aggregate types, which are mapped in different ways in different samples. There is one aggregate type for contacts:

[!code-csharp[ContactDetailsAggregate](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/BlogsContext.cs?name=ContactDetailsAggregate)]

And a second aggregate type for post metadata:

[!code-csharp[PostMetadataAggregate](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/BlogsContext.cs?name=PostMetadataAggregate)]

> [!TIP]
> The sample model can be found in [BlogsContext.cs](https://github.com/dotnet/EntityFramework.Docs/tree/main/samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/BlogsContext.cs).

## JSON Columns

Most relational databases support columns that contain JSON documents. The JSON in these columns can be drilled into with queries. This allows, for example, filtering and sorting by the elements of the documents, as well as projection of elements out of the documents into results. JSON columns allow relational databases to take on some of the characteristics of document databases, creating a useful hybrid between the two.

EF7 contains provider-agnostic support for JSON columns, with an implementation for SQL Server. This support allows mapping of aggregates built from .NET types to JSON documents. Normal LINQ queries can be used on the aggregates, and these will be translated to the appropriate query constructs needed to drill into the JSON. EF7 also supports updating and saving changes to the JSON documents.

> [!NOTE]
> SQLite support for JSON is [planned for post EF7](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/28816). The PostgreSQL and Pomelo MySQL providers already contain some support for JSON columns. We will be working with the authors of those providers to align JSON support across all providers.

### Mapping to JSON columns

In EF Core, aggregate types are defined using `OwnsOne` and `OwnsMany`. For example, consider the aggregate type from our sample model used to store contact information:

<!--
public class ContactDetails
{
    public Address Address { get; init; } = null!;
    public string? Phone { get; set; }
}

public class Address
{
    public Address(string street, string city, string postcode, string country)
    {
        Street = street;
        City = city;
        Postcode = postcode;
        Country = country;
    }

    public string Street { get; set; }
    public string City { get; set; }
    public string Postcode { get; set; }
    public string Country { get; set; }
}
-->
[!code-csharp[ContactDetailsAggregate](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/BlogsContext.cs?name=ContactDetailsAggregate)]

This can then be used in an "owner" entity type, for example, to store the contact details of an author:

```csharp
public class Author
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public ContactDetails Contact { get; set; }
}
```

The aggregate type is configured  in `OnModelCreating` using `OwnsOne`:

<!--
    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        modelBuilder.Entity<Author>().OwnsOne(
            author => author.Contact, ownedNavigationBuilder =>
            {
                ownedNavigationBuilder.OwnsOne(contactDetails => contactDetails.Address);
            });
    }
-->
[!code-csharp[TableSharingAggregate](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/JsonColumnsSample.cs?name=TableSharingAggregate)]

> [!TIP]
> The code shown here comes from [JsonColumnsSample.cs](https://github.com/dotnet/EntityFramework.Docs/tree/main/samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/JsonColumnsSample.cs).

By default, relational database providers map aggregate types like this to the same table as the owning entity type. That is, each property of the `ContactDetails` and `Address` classes are mapped to a column in the `Authors` table.

Some saved authors with contact details will look like this:

**Authors**

| Id  | Name             | Contact\_Address\_Street | Contact\_Address\_City | Contact\_Address\_Postcode | Contact\_Address\_Country | Contact\_Phone |
|:----|:-----------------|:-------------------------|:-----------------------|:---------------------------|:--------------------------|:---------------|
| 1   | Maddy Montaquila | 1 Main St                | Camberwick Green       | CW1 5ZH                    | UK                        | 01632 12345    |
| 2   | Jeremy Likness   | 2 Main St                | Chigley                | CW1 5ZH                    | UK                        | 01632 12346    |
| 3   | Daniel Roth      | 3 Main St                | Camberwick Green       | CW1 5ZH                    | UK                        | 01632 12347    |
| 4   | Arthur Vickers   | 15a Main St              | Chigley                | CW1 5ZH                    | United Kingdom            | 01632 22345    |
| 5   | Brice Lambson    | 4 Main St                | Chigley                | CW1 5ZH                    | UK                        | 01632 12349    |

If desired, each entity type making up the aggregate can be mapped to its own table instead:

<!--
    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        modelBuilder.Entity<Author>().OwnsOne(
            author => author.Contact, ownedNavigationBuilder =>
            {
                ownedNavigationBuilder.ToTable("Contacts");
                ownedNavigationBuilder.OwnsOne(contactDetails => contactDetails.Address, ownedOwnedNavigationBuilder =>
                {
                    ownedOwnedNavigationBuilder.ToTable("Addresses");
                });
            });
    }
-->
[!code-csharp[TableMappedAggregate](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/JsonColumnsSample.cs?name=TableMappedAggregate)]

The same data is then stored across three tables:

**Authors**

| Id  | Name             |
|:----|:-----------------|
| 1   | Maddy Montaquila |
| 2   | Jeremy Likness   |
| 3   | Daniel Roth      |
| 4   | Arthur Vickers   |
| 5   | Brice Lambson    |

**Contacts**

| AuthorId | Phone       |
|:---------|:------------|
| 1        | 01632 12345 |
| 2        | 01632 12346 |
| 3        | 01632 12347 |
| 4        | 01632 22345 |
| 5        | 01632 12349 |

**Addresses**

| ContactDetailsAuthorId | Street      | City             | Postcode | Country        |
|:-----------------------|:------------|:-----------------|:---------|:---------------|
| 1                      | 1 Main St   | Camberwick Green | CW1 5ZH  | UK             |
| 2                      | 2 Main St   | Chigley          | CW1 5ZH  | UK             |
| 3                      | 3 Main St   | Camberwick Green | CW1 5ZH  | UK             |
| 4                      | 15a Main St | Chigley          | CW1 5ZH  | United Kingdom |
| 5                      | 4 Main St   | Chigley          | CW1 5ZH  | UK             |

Now, for the interesting part. In EF7, the `ContactDetails` aggregate type can be mapped to a JSON column. This requires just one call to `ToJson()` when configuring the aggregate type:  

<!--
    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        modelBuilder.Entity<Author>().OwnsOne(
            author => author.Contact, ownedNavigationBuilder =>
            {
                ownedNavigationBuilder.ToJson();
                ownedNavigationBuilder.OwnsOne(contactDetails => contactDetails.Address);
            });
    }
-->
[!code-csharp[JsonColumnAggregate](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/JsonColumnsSample.cs?name=JsonColumnAggregate)]

The `Authors` table will now contain a JSON column for `ContactDetails` populated with a JSON document for each author:

**Authors**

| Id  | Name             | Contact                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|:----|:-----------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1   | Maddy Montaquila | {<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Phone":"01632 12345",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Address": {<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"City":"Camberwick Green",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Country":"UK",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Postcode":"CW1 5ZH",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Street":"1 Main St"<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br/>} |
| 2   | Jeremy Likness   | {<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Phone":"01632 12346",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Address": {<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"City":"Chigley",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Country":"UK",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Postcode":"CH1 5ZH",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Street":"2 Main St"<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br/>}          |
| 3   | Daniel Roth      | {<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Phone":"01632 12347",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Address": {<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"City":"Camberwick Green",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Country":"UK",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Postcode":"CW1 5ZH",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Street":"3 Main St"<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br/>} |
| 4   | Arthur Vickers   | {<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Phone":"01632 12348",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Address": {<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"City":"Chigley",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Country":"UK",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Postcode":"CH1 5ZH",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Street":"15a Main St"<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br/>}        |
| 5   | Brice Lambson    | {<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Phone":"01632 12349",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;"Address": {<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"City":"Chigley",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Country":"UK",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Postcode":"CH1 5ZH",<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Street":"4 Main St"<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br/>}          |

> [!TIP]
> This use of aggregates is very similar to the way JSON documents are mapped when using the EF Core provider for Azure Cosmos DB. JSON columns bring the capabilities of using EF Core against document databases to documents embedded in a relational database.

The JSON documents shown above are very simple, but this mapping capability can also be used with more complex document structures. For example, consider another aggregate type from our sample model, used to represent metadata about a post:

<!--
public class PostMetadata
{
    public PostMetadata(int views)
    {
        Views = views;
    }

    public int Views { get; set; }
    public List<SearchTerm> TopSearches { get; } = new();
    public List<Visits> TopGeographies { get; } = new();
    public List<PostUpdate> Updates { get; } = new();
}

public class SearchTerm
{
    public SearchTerm(string term, int count)
    {
        Term = term;
        Count = count;
    }

    public string Term { get; private set; }
    public int Count { get; private set; }
}

public class Visits
{
    public Visits(double latitude, double longitude, int count)
    {
        Latitude = latitude;
        Longitude = longitude;
        Count = count;
    }

    public double Latitude { get; private set; }
    public double Longitude { get; private set; }
    public int Count { get; private set; }
    public List<string>? Browsers { get; set; }
}

public class PostUpdate
{
    public PostUpdate(IPAddress postedFrom, DateTime updatedOn)
    {
        PostedFrom = postedFrom;
        UpdatedOn = updatedOn;
    }

    public IPAddress PostedFrom { get; private set; }
    public string? UpdatedBy { get; init; }
    public DateTime UpdatedOn { get; private set; }
    public List<Commit> Commits { get; } = new();
}

public class Commit
{
    public Commit(DateTime committedOn, string comment)
    {
        CommittedOn = committedOn;
        Comment = comment;
    }

    public DateTime CommittedOn { get; private set; }
    public string Comment { get; set; }
}
-->
[!code-csharp[PostMetadataAggregate](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/BlogsContext.cs?name=PostMetadataAggregate)]

This aggregate type contains several nested types and collections. Calls to `OwnsOne` and `OwnsMany` are used to map this aggregate type:

<!--
        modelBuilder.Entity<Post>().OwnsOne(
            post => post.Metadata, ownedNavigationBuilder =>
            {
                ownedNavigationBuilder.ToJson();
                ownedNavigationBuilder.OwnsMany(metadata => metadata.TopSearches);
                ownedNavigationBuilder.OwnsMany(metadata => metadata.TopGeographies);
                ownedNavigationBuilder.OwnsMany(
                    metadata => metadata.Updates,
                    ownedOwnedNavigationBuilder => ownedOwnedNavigationBuilder.OwnsMany(update => update.Commits));
            });
-->
[!code-csharp[PostMetadataConfig](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/JsonColumnsSample.cs?name=PostMetadataConfig)]

> [!TIP]
> `ToJson` is only needed on the aggregate root to map the entire aggregate to a JSON document.

With this mapping, EF7 can create and query into a complex JSON document like this:

```json
{
  "Views": 5085,
  "TopGeographies": [
    {
      "Browsers": "Firefox, Netscape",
      "Count": 924,
      "Latitude": 110.793,
      "Longitude": 39.2431
    },
    {
      "Browsers": "Firefox, Netscape",
      "Count": 885,
      "Latitude": 133.793,
      "Longitude": 45.2431
    }
  ],
  "TopSearches": [
    {
      "Count": 9359,
      "Term": "Search #1"
    }
  ],
  "Updates": [
    {
      "PostedFrom": "127.0.0.1",
      "UpdatedBy": "Admin",
      "UpdatedOn": "1996-02-17T19:24:29.5429092Z",
      "Commits": []
    },
    {
      "PostedFrom": "127.0.0.1",
      "UpdatedBy": "Admin",
      "UpdatedOn": "2019-11-24T19:24:29.5429093Z",
      "Commits": [
        {
          "Comment": "Commit #1",
          "CommittedOn": "2022-08-21T00:00:00+01:00"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "PostedFrom": "127.0.0.1",
      "UpdatedBy": "Admin",
      "UpdatedOn": "1997-05-28T19:24:29.5429097Z",
      "Commits": [
        {
          "Comment": "Commit #1",
          "CommittedOn": "2022-08-21T00:00:00+01:00"
        },
        {
          "Comment": "Commit #2",
          "CommittedOn": "2022-08-21T00:00:00+01:00"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Queries into JSON columns

Queries into JSON columns work just the same as querying into any other aggregate type in EF Core. That is, just use LINQ! Here are some examples.

A query for all authors that live in Chigley:

<!--
        var authorsInChigley = await context.Authors
            .Where(author => author.Contact.Address.City == "Chigley")
            .ToListAsync();
-->
[!code-csharp[AuthorsInChigley](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/JsonColumnsSample.cs?name=AuthorsInChigley)]

This query generates the following SQL when using SQL Server:

```sql
SELECT [a].[Id], [a].[Name], JSON_QUERY([a].[Contact],'$')
FROM [Authors] AS [a]
WHERE CAST(JSON_VALUE([a].[Contact],'$.Address.City') AS nvarchar(max)) = N'Chigley'
```

Notice the use of `JSON_VALUE` to get the `City` from the `Address` inside the JSON document.

`Select` can be used to extract and project elements from the JSON document:

<!--
        var postcodesInChigley = await context.Authors
            .Where(author => author.Contact.Address.City == "Chigley")
            .Select(author => author.Contact.Address.Postcode)
            .ToListAsync();
-->
[!code-csharp[PostcodesInChigley](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/JsonColumnsSample.cs?name=PostcodesInChigley)]

This query generates the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT CAST(JSON_VALUE([a].[Contact],'$.Address.Postcode') AS nvarchar(max))
FROM [Authors] AS [a]
WHERE CAST(JSON_VALUE([a].[Contact],'$.Address.City') AS nvarchar(max)) = N'Chigley'
```

Here's an example that does a bit more in the filter and projection, and also orders by the phone number in the JSON document:

<!--
        var orderedAddresses = await context.Authors
            .Where(
                author => (author.Contact.Address.City == "Chigley"
                           && author.Contact.Phone != null)
                          || author.Name.StartsWith("D"))
            .OrderBy(author => author.Contact.Phone)
            .Select(
                author => author.Name + " (" + author.Contact.Address.Street
                          + ", " + author.Contact.Address.City
                          + " " + author.Contact.Address.Postcode + ")")
            .ToListAsync();
-->
[!code-csharp[OrderedAddresses](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/JsonColumnsSample.cs?name=OrderedAddresses)]

This query generates the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT (((((([a].[Name] + N' (') + CAST(JSON_VALUE([a].[Contact],'$.Address.Street') AS nvarchar(max))) + N', ') + CAST(JSON_VALUE([a].[Contact],'$.Address.City') AS nvarchar(max))) + N' ') + CAST(JSON_VALUE([a].[Contact],'$.Address.Postcode') AS nvarchar(max))) + N')'
FROM [Authors] AS [a]
WHERE (CAST(JSON_VALUE([a].[Contact],'$.Address.City') AS nvarchar(max)) = N'Chigley' AND CAST(JSON_VALUE([a].[Contact],'$.Phone') AS nvarchar(max)) IS NOT NULL) OR ([a].[Name] LIKE N'D%')
ORDER BY CAST(JSON_VALUE([a].[Contact],'$.Phone') AS nvarchar(max))
```

And when the JSON document contains collections, then these can be projected out in the results:

<!--
        var postsWithViews = await context.Posts.Where(post => post.Metadata!.Views > 3000)
            .AsNoTracking()
            .Select(
                post => new
                {
                    post.Author!.Name,
                    post.Metadata!.Views,
                    Searches = post.Metadata.TopSearches,
                    Commits = post.Metadata.Updates
                })
            .ToListAsync();
-->
[!code-csharp[PostsWithViews](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/JsonColumnsSample.cs?name=PostsWithViews)]

This query generates the following SQL:

```sql
SELECT [a].[Name], CAST(JSON_VALUE([p].[Metadata],'$.Views') AS int), JSON_QUERY([p].[Metadata],'$.TopSearches'), [p].[Id], JSON_QUERY([p].[Metadata],'$.Updates')
FROM [Posts] AS [p]
LEFT JOIN [Authors] AS [a] ON [p].[AuthorId] = [a].[Id]
WHERE CAST(JSON_VALUE([p].[Metadata],'$.Views') AS int) > 3000
```

> [!NOTE]

### Updating JSON columns

[`SaveChanges` and `SaveChangesAsync`](xref:core/saving/basic) work in the normal way to make updates a JSON column. For extensive changes, the entire document will be updated. For example, replacing most of the `Contact` document for an author:

<!--
        var jeremy = await context.Authors.SingleAsync(author => author.Name.StartsWith("Jeremy"));

        jeremy.Contact = new() { Address = new("2 Riverside", "Trimbridge", "TB1 5ZS", "UK"), Phone = "01632 88346" };

        await context.SaveChangesAsync();
-->
[!code-csharp[UpdateDocument](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/JsonColumnsSample.cs?name=UpdateDocument)]

In this case, the entire new document is passed as a parameter to the `Update` command:

```text
info: 8/30/2022 20:21:24.392 RelationalEventId.CommandExecuted[20101] (Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Database.Command)
      Executed DbCommand (2ms) [Parameters=[@p0='{"Phone":"01632 88346","Address":{"City":"Trimbridge","Country":"UK","Postcode":"TB1 5ZS","Street":"2 Riverside"}}' (Nullable = false) (Size = 114), @p1='2'], CommandType='Text', CommandTimeout='30']
```

```sql
      SET IMPLICIT_TRANSACTIONS OFF;
      SET NOCOUNT ON;
      UPDATE [Authors] SET [Contact] = @p0
      OUTPUT 1
      WHERE [Id] = @p1;
```

However, if only a sub-document is changed, then EF Core will use a "JSON_MODIFY" command to update only the sub-document. For example, changing the `Address` inside a `Contact` document:

<!--
        var brice = await context.Authors.SingleAsync(author => author.Name.StartsWith("Brice"));

        brice.Contact.Address = new("4 Riverside", "Trimbridge", "TB1 5ZS", "UK");

        await context.SaveChangesAsync();
-->
[!code-csharp[UpdateSubDocument](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/JsonColumnsSample.cs?name=UpdateSubDocument)]

Generates the following SQL:

```text
info: 8/30/2022 20:53:01.669 RelationalEventId.CommandExecuted[20101] (Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Database.Command)
      Executed DbCommand (2ms) [Parameters=[], CommandType='Text', CommandTimeout='30']
      SELECT TOP(2) [a].[Id], [a].[Name], JSON_QUERY([a].[Contact],'$')
      FROM [Authors] AS [a]
      WHERE [a].[Name] LIKE N'Brice%'
```

```sql
info: 8/30/2022 20:53:01.676 RelationalEventId.CommandExecuted[20101] (Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Database.Command)
      Executed DbCommand (2ms) [Parameters=[@p0='{"City":"Trimbridge","Country":"UK","Postcode":"TB1 5ZS","Street":"4 Riverside"}' (Nullable = false) (Size = 80), @p1='5'], CommandType='Text', CommandTimeout='30']
      SET IMPLICIT_TRANSACTIONS OFF;
      SET NOCOUNT ON;
      UPDATE [Authors] SET [Contact] = JSON_MODIFY([Contact], 'strict $.Address', JSON_QUERY(@p0))
      OUTPUT 1
      WHERE [Id] = @p1;
```

Finally, if only a single property is changed, then EF Core will again use a "JSON_MODIFY" command, this time to patch only the changed property value. For example:

<!--
        var arthur = await context.Authors.SingleAsync(author => author.Name.StartsWith("Arthur"));

        arthur.Contact.Address.Country = "United Kingdom";

        await context.SaveChangesAsync();
-->
[!code-csharp[UpdateProperty](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/JsonColumnsSample.cs?name=UpdateProperty)]

Generates the following SQL:

```text
info: 8/30/2022 20:24:04.677 RelationalEventId.CommandExecuted[20101] (Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Database.Command)
      Executed DbCommand (2ms) [Parameters=[@p0='["United Kingdom"]' (Nullable = false) (Size = 18), @p1='4'], CommandType='Text', CommandTimeout='30']
```

```sql
SET IMPLICIT_TRANSACTIONS OFF;
SET NOCOUNT ON;
UPDATE [Authors] SET [Contact] = JSON_MODIFY(
    [Contact], 'strict $.Address.Country', JSON_VALUE(@p0, '$[0]'))
OUTPUT 1
WHERE [Id] = @p1;
```

## ExecuteUpdate and ExecuteDelete (Bulk updates)

By default, EF Core [tracks changes to entities](xref:core/change-tracking/index), and then [sends updates to the database](xref:core/saving/index) when one of the `SaveChanges` methods is called. Changes are only sent for properties and relationships that have actually changed. Also, the tracked entities remain in sync with the changes sent to the database. This mechanism is an efficient and convenient way to send general-purpose inserts, updates, and deletes to the database. These changes are also batched to reduce the number of database round-trips.

However, it is sometimes useful to execute update or delete commands on the database without involving the change tracker. EF7 enables this with the new `ExecuteUpdate` and `ExecuteDelete` methods. These methods are applied to a LINQ query and will update or delete entities in the database based on the results of that query. Many entities can be updated with a single command and the entities are not loaded into memory, which means this can result in more efficient updates and deletes.

However, keep in mind that:

- The specific changes to make must be specified explicitly; they are not automatically detected by EF Core.
- Any tracked entities will not be kept in sync.
- Additional commands may need to be sent in the correct order so as not to violate database constraints. For example deleting dependents before a principal can be deleted.

All of this means that the `ExecuteUpdate` and `ExecuteDelete` methods complement, rather than replace, the existing `SaveChanges` mechanism.

### Basic `ExecuteDelete` examples

> [!TIP]
> The code shown here comes from [ExecuteDeleteSample.cs](https://github.com/dotnet/EntityFramework.Docs/tree/main/samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/ExecuteDeleteSample.cs).

Calling `ExecuteDelete` or `ExecuteDeleteAsync` on a `DbSet` immediately deletes all entities of that `DbSet` from the database. For example, to delete all `Tag` entities:

<!--
        await context.Tags.ExecuteDeleteAsync();
-->
[!code-csharp[DeleteAllTags](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/ExecuteDeleteSample.cs?name=DeleteAllTags)]

This executes the following SQL when using SQL Server:

```sql
DELETE FROM [t]
FROM [Tags] AS [t]
```

More interestingly, the query can contain a filter. For example:

<!--
        await context.Tags.Where(t => t.Text.Contains(".NET")).ExecuteDeleteAsync();
-->
[!code-csharp[DeleteTagsContainingDotNet](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/ExecuteDeleteSample.cs?name=DeleteTagsContainingDotNet)]

This executes the following SQL:

```sql
DELETE FROM [t]
FROM [Tags] AS [t]
WHERE [t].[Text] LIKE N'%.NET%'
```

The query can also use more complex filters, including navigations to other types. For example, to delete tags only from old blog posts:

<!--
        await context.Tags.Where(t => t.Posts.All(e => e.PublishedOn.Year < 2022)).ExecuteDeleteAsync();
-->
[!code-csharp[DeleteTagsFromOldPosts](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/ExecuteDeleteSample.cs?name=DeleteTagsFromOldPosts)]

Which executes:

```sql
DELETE FROM [t]
FROM [Tags] AS [t]
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM [PostTag] AS [p]
    INNER JOIN [Posts] AS [p0] ON [p].[PostsId] = [p0].[Id]
    WHERE [t].[Id] = [p].[TagsId] AND NOT (DATEPART(year, [p0].[PublishedOn]) < 2022))
```

### Basic `ExecuteUpdate` examples

> [!TIP]
> The code shown here comes from [ExecuteUpdateSample.cs](https://github.com/dotnet/EntityFramework.Docs/tree/main/samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/ExecuteUpdateSample.cs).

`ExecuteUpdate` and `ExecuteUpdateAsync` behave in a very similar way to the `ExecuteDelete` methods. The main difference is that an update requires knowing _which_ properties to update, and _how_ to update them. This is achieved using one or more calls to `SetProperty`. For example, to update the `Name` of every blog:

<!--
        await context.Blogs.ExecuteUpdateAsync(
            s => s.SetProperty(b => b.Name, b => b.Name + " *Featured!*"));
-->
[!code-csharp[UpdateAllBlogs](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/ExecuteUpdateSample.cs?name=UpdateAllBlogs)]

The first parameter of `SetProperty` specifies which property to update; in this case, `Blog.Name`. The second parameter specifies how the new value should be calculated; in this case, by taking the existing value and appending `"*Featured!*"`. The resulting SQL is:

```sql
UPDATE [b]
    SET [b].[Name] = [b].[Name] + N' *Featured!*'
FROM [Blogs] AS [b]
```

As with `ExecuteDelete`, the query can be used to filter which entities are updated. In addition, multiple calls to `SetProperty` can be used to update more than one property on the target entity. For example, to update the `Title` and `Content` of all posts published before 2022:

<!--
            .Where(p => p.PublishedOn.Year < 2022)
            .ExecuteUpdateAsync(s => s
                .SetProperty(b => b.Title, b => b.Title + " (" + b.PublishedOn.Year + ")")
                .SetProperty(b => b.Content, b => b.Content + " ( This content was published in " + b.PublishedOn.Year + ")"));
-->
[!code-csharp[UpdateOldPosts](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/ExecuteUpdateSample.cs?name=UpdateOldPosts)]

In this case the generated SQL is a bit more complicated:

```sql
UPDATE [p]
    SET [p].[Content] = (([p].[Content] + N' ( This content was published in ') + COALESCE(CAST(DATEPART(year, [p].[PublishedOn]) AS nvarchar(max)), N'')) + N')',
    [p].[Title] = (([p].[Title] + N' (') + COALESCE(CAST(DATEPART(year, [p].[PublishedOn]) AS nvarchar(max)), N'')) + N')'
FROM [Posts] AS [p]
WHERE DATEPART(year, [p].[PublishedOn]) < 2022
```

Finally, again as with `ExecuteDelete`, the filter can reference other tables. For example, to update all tags from old posts:

<!--
        await context.Tags
            .Where(t => t.Posts.All(e => e.PublishedOn.Year < 2022))
            .ExecuteUpdateAsync(s => s.SetProperty(t => t.Text, t => t.Text + " (old)"));
-->
[!code-csharp[UpdateTagsOnOldPosts](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/ExecuteUpdateSample.cs?name=UpdateTagsOnOldPosts)]

Which generates:

```sql
UPDATE [t]
    SET [t].[Text] = [t].[Text] + N' (old)'
FROM [Tags] AS [t]
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM [PostTag] AS [p]
    INNER JOIN [Posts] AS [p0] ON [p].[PostsId] = [p0].[Id]
    WHERE [t].[Id] = [p].[TagsId] AND NOT (DATEPART(year, [p0].[PublishedOn]) < 2022))
```

### Inheritance and multiple tables

`ExecuteUpdate` and `ExecuteDelete` can only act on a single table. This has implications when working with different [inheritance mapping strategies](xref:core/modeling/inheritance). Generally, there are no problems when using the TPH mapping strategy, since there is only one table to modify. For example, deleting all `FeaturedPost` entities:

<!--
        await context.Set<FeaturedPost>().ExecuteDeleteAsync();
-->
[!code-csharp[DeleteFeaturedPosts](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/ExecuteDeleteSample.cs?name=DeleteFeaturedPosts)]

Generates the following SQL when using TPH mapping:

```sql
DELETE FROM [p]
FROM [Posts] AS [p]
WHERE [p].[Discriminator] = N'FeaturedPost'
```

There are also no issues for this case when using the TPC mapping strategy, since again only changes to a single table are needed:

```sql
DELETE FROM [f]
FROM [FeaturedPosts] AS [f]
```

However, attempting this when using the TPT mapping strategy will fail since it would require deleting rows from two different tables.

Adding a filter to the query often means the operation will fail with both the TPC and TPT strategies. This is again because the rows may need to be deleted from multiple tables. For example, this query:

<!--
        await context.Posts.Where(p => p.Author.Name.StartsWith("Arthur")).ExecuteDeleteAsync();
-->
[!code-csharp[DeletePostsForGivenAuthor](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/ExecuteDeleteSample.cs?name=DeletePostsForGivenAuthor)]

Generates the following SQL when using TPH:

```sql
DELETE FROM [p]
FROM [Posts] AS [p]
LEFT JOIN [Authors] AS [a] ON [p].[AuthorId] = [a].[Id]
WHERE [a].[Name] IS NOT NULL AND ([a].[Name] LIKE N'Arthur%')
```

But fails when using TPC or TPT.

### `ExecuteDelete` and relationships

As mentioned above, it may be necessary to delete or update dependent entities before the principal of a relationship can be deleted. For example, each `Post` is a dependent of its associated `Author`. This means that an author cannot be deleted if a post still references it; doing so will violate the foreign key constraint in the database. For example, attempting this:

```csharp
await context.Authors.ExecuteDeleteAsync();
```

Will result in the following exception on SQL Server:

> Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SqlException (0x80131904): The DELETE statement conflicted with the REFERENCE constraint "FK_Posts_Authors_AuthorId". The conflict occurred in database "TphBlogsContext", table "dbo.Posts", column 'AuthorId'.
The statement has been terminated.

To fix this, we must first either delete the posts, or sever the relationship between each post and its author by setting `AuthorId` foreign key property to null. For example, using the delete option:

<!--
        await context.Posts.TagWith("Deleting posts...").ExecuteDeleteAsync();
        await context.Authors.TagWith("Deleting authors...").ExecuteDeleteAsync();
-->
[!code-csharp[DeleteAllAuthors](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/ExecuteDeleteSample.cs?name=DeleteAllAuthors)]

> [!TIP]
> `TagWith` can be used to tag `ExecuteDelete` or `ExecuteUpdate` in the same way as it tags normal queries.

This results in two separate commands; the first to delete the dependents:

```sql
-- Deleting posts...

DELETE FROM [p]
FROM [Posts] AS [p]
```

And the second to delete the principals:

```sql
-- Deleting authors...

DELETE FROM [a]
FROM [Authors] AS [a]
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Multiple `ExecuteDelete` and `ExecuteUpdate` commands will not be contained in a single transaction by default. However, the [DbContext transaction APIs](xref:core/saving/transactions) can be used in the normal way to wrap these commands in a transaction.

> [!TIP]
> Sending these commands in a single round-trip depends on [Issue #10879](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/10879). Vote for this issue if it's something you would like to see implemented.

Configuring [cascade deletes](xref:core/saving/cascade-delete) in the database can be very useful here. In our model, the relationship between `Blog` and `Post` is required, which causes EF Core to configure a cascade delete by convention.  This means when a blog is deleted in the database, then all its dependent posts will also be deleted. It then follows that to delete all blogs and posts we need only delete the blogs:

<!--
        await context.Blogs.ExecuteDeleteAsync();
-->
[!code-csharp[DeleteAllBlogsAndPosts](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/ExecuteDeleteSample.cs?name=DeleteAllBlogsAndPosts)]

This results in the following SQL:

```sql
DELETE FROM [b]
FROM [Blogs] AS [b]
```

Which, as it is deleting a blog, will also cause all related posts to be deleted by the configured cascade delete.

## Table-per-concrete-type (TPC) inheritance mapping

By default, EF Core maps an inheritance hierarchy of .NET types to a single database table. This is known as the [table-per-hierarchy (TPH)](xref:core/modeling/inheritance#table-per-hierarchy-and-discriminator-configuration) mapping strategy. EF Core 5.0 introduced the [table-per-type (TPT)](xref:core/modeling/inheritance#table-per-type-configuration) strategy, which supports mapping each .NET type to a different database table. EF7 introduces the table-per-concrete-type (TPC) strategy. TPC also maps .NET types to different tables, but in a way that addresses some common performance issues with the TPT strategy.

> [!TIP]
> The code shown here comes from [TpcInheritanceSample.cs](https://github.com/dotnet/EntityFramework.Docs/tree/main/samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/TpcInheritanceSample.cs).

> [!TIP]
> The EF Team demonstrated and talked in depth about TPC mapping in an episode of the .NET Data Community Standup. As with [all Community Standup episodes](https://aka.ms/efstandups), you can [watch the TPC episode now on YouTube](https://youtu.be/HaL6DKW1mrg).

### TPC database schema

The TPC strategy is similar to the TPT strategy except that a different table is created for every _concrete_ type in the hierarchy, but tables are **not** created for _abstract_ types--hence the name “table-per-concrete-type”. As with TPT, the table itself indicates the type of the object saved. However, unlike TPT mapping, each table contains columns for every property in the concrete type and its base types. TPC database schemas are denormalized.

For example, consider mapping this hierarchy:

<!--
    public abstract class Animal
    {
        protected Animal(string name)
        {
            Name = name;
        }

        public int Id { get; set; }
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public abstract string Species { get; }

        public Food? Food { get; set; }
    }

    public abstract class Pet : Animal
    {
        protected Pet(string name)
            : base(name)
        {
        }

        public string? Vet { get; set; }

        public ICollection<Human> Humans { get; } = new List<Human>();
    }

    public class FarmAnimal : Animal
    {
        public FarmAnimal(string name, string species)
            : base(name)
        {
            Species = species;
        }

        public override string Species { get; }

        [Precision(18, 2)]
        public decimal Value { get; set; }

        public override string ToString()
            => $"Farm animal '{Name}' ({Species}/{Id}) worth {Value:C} eats {Food?.ToString() ?? "<Unknown>"}";
    }

    public class Cat : Pet
    {
        public Cat(string name, string educationLevel)
            : base(name)
        {
            EducationLevel = educationLevel;
        }

        public string EducationLevel { get; set; }
        public override string Species => "Felis catus";

        public override string ToString()
            => $"Cat '{Name}' ({Species}/{Id}) with education '{EducationLevel}' eats {Food?.ToString() ?? "<Unknown>"}";
    }

    public class Dog : Pet
    {
        public Dog(string name, string favoriteToy)
            : base(name)
        {
            FavoriteToy = favoriteToy;
        }

        public string FavoriteToy { get; set; }
        public override string Species => "Canis familiaris";

        public override string ToString()
            => $"Dog '{Name}' ({Species}/{Id}) with favorite toy '{FavoriteToy}' eats {Food?.ToString() ?? "<Unknown>"}";
    }

    public class Human : Animal
    {
        public Human(string name)
            : base(name)
        {
        }

        public override string Species => "Homo sapiens";

        public Animal? FavoriteAnimal { get; set; }
        public ICollection<Pet> Pets { get; } = new List<Pet>();

        public override string ToString()
            => $"Human '{Name}' ({Species}/{Id}) with favorite animal '{FavoriteAnimal?.Name ?? "<Unknown>"}'" +
               $" eats {Food?.ToString() ?? "<Unknown>"}";
    }
-->
[!code-csharp[AnimalsHierarchy](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/TpcInheritanceSample.cs?name=AnimalsHierarchy)]

When using SQL Server, the tables created for this hierarchy are:

```sql
CREATE TABLE [Cats] (
    [Id] int NOT NULL DEFAULT (NEXT VALUE FOR [AnimalSequence]),
    [Name] nvarchar(max) NOT NULL,
    [FoodId] uniqueidentifier NULL,
    [Vet] nvarchar(max) NULL,
    [EducationLevel] nvarchar(max) NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT [PK_Cats] PRIMARY KEY ([Id]));

CREATE TABLE [Dogs] (
    [Id] int NOT NULL DEFAULT (NEXT VALUE FOR [AnimalSequence]),
    [Name] nvarchar(max) NOT NULL,
    [FoodId] uniqueidentifier NULL,
    [Vet] nvarchar(max) NULL,
    [FavoriteToy] nvarchar(max) NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT [PK_Dogs] PRIMARY KEY ([Id]));

CREATE TABLE [FarmAnimals] (
    [Id] int NOT NULL DEFAULT (NEXT VALUE FOR [AnimalSequence]),
    [Name] nvarchar(max) NOT NULL,
    [FoodId] uniqueidentifier NULL,
    [Value] decimal(18,2) NOT NULL,
    [Species] nvarchar(max) NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT [PK_FarmAnimals] PRIMARY KEY ([Id]));

CREATE TABLE [Humans] (
    [Id] int NOT NULL DEFAULT (NEXT VALUE FOR [AnimalSequence]),
    [Name] nvarchar(max) NOT NULL,
    [FoodId] uniqueidentifier NULL,
    [FavoriteAnimalId] int NULL,
    CONSTRAINT [PK_Humans] PRIMARY KEY ([Id]));
```

Notice that:

- There are no tables for the `Animal` or `Pet` types, since these are `abstract` in the object model. Remember that C# does not allow instances of abstract types, and there is therefore no situation where an abstract type instance will be saved to the database.
- The mapping of properties in base types is repeated for each concrete type. For example, every table has a `Name` column, and both Cats and Dogs have a `Vet` column.

- Saving some data into this database results in the following:

**Cats table**

| Id  | Name   | FoodId                               | Vet                  | EducationLevel |

Notice that, unlike with TPT mapping, all the information for a single object is contained in a single table. And, unlike with TPH mapping, there is no combination of column and row in any table where that is never used by the model. We'll see below how these characteristics can be important for queries and storage.

### Configuring TPC inheritance

All types in an inheritance hierarchy must be explicitly included in the model when mapping the hierarchy with EF Core. This can be done by creating `DbSet` properties on your `DbContext` for every type:

<!--
        public DbSet<Animal> Animals => Set<Animal>();
        public DbSet<Pet> Pets => Set<Pet>();
        public DbSet<FarmAnimal> FarmAnimals => Set<FarmAnimal>();
        public DbSet<Cat> Cats => Set<Cat>();
        public DbSet<Dog> Dogs => Set<Dog>();
        public DbSet<Human> Humans => Set<Human>();
-->
[!code-csharp[AnimalSets](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/TpcInheritanceSample.cs?name=AnimalSets)]

Or by using the `Entity` method in `OnModelCreating`:

<!--
            modelBuilder.Entity<Animal>();
            modelBuilder.Entity<Pet>();
            modelBuilder.Entity<Cat>();
            modelBuilder.Entity<Dog>();
            modelBuilder.Entity<FarmAnimal>();
            modelBuilder.Entity<Human>();
-->
[!code-csharp[AnimalsInModelBuilder](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/TpcInheritanceSample.cs?name=AnimalsInModelBuilder)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is different from the legacy EF6 behavior, where derived types of mapped base types would be automatically discovered if they were contained in the same assembly.

Nothing else needs to be done to map the hierarchy as TPH, since it is the default strategy. However, starting with EF7, TPH can made explicit by calling `UseTphMappingStrategy` on the base type of the hierarchy:

<!--
            modelBuilder.Entity<Animal>().UseTphMappingStrategy();
-->
[!code-csharp[UseTphMappingStrategy](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/TpcInheritanceSample.cs?name=UseTphMappingStrategy)]

To use TPT instead, change this to `UseTptMappingStrategy`:

<!--
            modelBuilder.Entity<Animal>().UseTptMappingStrategy();
-->
[!code-csharp[UseTptMappingStrategy](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/TpcInheritanceSample.cs?name=UseTptMappingStrategy)]

Likewise, `UseTpcMappingStrategy` is used to configure TPC:

<!--
            modelBuilder.Entity<Animal>().UseTpcMappingStrategy();
-->
[!code-csharp[UseTpcMappingStrategy](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/TpcInheritanceSample.cs?name=UseTpcMappingStrategy)]

In each case, the table name used for each type is taken from the `DbSet` property name on your `DbContext`, or [can be configured](xref:core/modeling/entity-types#table-name) using the `ToTable` builder method, or the `[Table]` attribute.

### TPC query performance

For queries, the TPC strategy is an improvement over TPT because it ensures that the information for a given entity instance is always stored in a single table. This means the TPC strategy can be useful when the mapped hierarchy is large and has many concrete (usually leaf) types, each with a large number of properties, and where only a small subset of types are used in most queries.

The SQL generated for three simple LINQ queries can be used to observe where TPC does well when compared to TPH and TPT. These queries are:

1. A query that returns entities of all types in the hierarchy:

   ```csharp
   context.Animals.ToList();
   ```

2. A query that returns entities from a subset of types in the hierarchy:

   ```csharp
   context.Pets.ToList();
   ```

3. A query that returns only entities from a single leaf type in the hierarchy:

   ```csharp
   context.Cats.ToList();
   ```

#### TPH queries

When using TPH, all three queries only query a single table, but with different filters on the discriminator column:

1. TPH SQL returning entities of all types in the hierarchy:

   ```sql
   SELECT [a].[Id], [a].[Discriminator], [a].[FoodId], [a].[Name], [a].[Species], [a].[Value], [a].[FavoriteAnimalId], [a].[Vet], [a].[EducationLevel], [a].[FavoriteToy]
   FROM [Animals] AS [a]
   ```

2. TPH SQL returning entities from a subset of types in the hierarchy:

   ```sql
   SELECT [a].[Id], [a].[Discriminator], [a].[FoodId], [a].[Name], [a].[Vet], [a].[EducationLevel], [a].[FavoriteToy]
   FROM [Animals] AS [a]
   WHERE [a].[Discriminator] IN (N'Cat', N'Dog')
   ```

3. TPH SQL returning only entities from a single leaf type in the hierarchy:

   ```sql
   SELECT [a].[Id], [a].[Discriminator], [a].[FoodId], [a].[Name], [a].[Vet], [a].[EducationLevel]
   FROM [Animals] AS [a]
   WHERE [a].[Discriminator] = N'Cat'
   ```

All these queries should perform well, especially with an appropriate database index on the discriminator column.

#### TPT queries

When using TPT, all of these queries require joining multiple tables, since the data for any given concrete type is split across many tables:

1. TPT SQL returning entities of all types in the hierarchy:

   ```sql
   SELECT [a].[Id], [a].[FoodId], [a].[Name], [f].[Species], [f].[Value], [h].[FavoriteAnimalId], [p].[Vet], [c].[EducationLevel], [d].[FavoriteToy], CASE
       WHEN [d].[Id] IS NOT NULL THEN N'Dog'
       WHEN [c].[Id] IS NOT NULL THEN N'Cat'
       WHEN [h].[Id] IS NOT NULL THEN N'Human'
       WHEN [f].[Id] IS NOT NULL THEN N'FarmAnimal'
   END AS [Discriminator]
   FROM [Animals] AS [a]
   LEFT JOIN [FarmAnimals] AS [f] ON [a].[Id] = [f].[Id]
   LEFT JOIN [Humans] AS [h] ON [a].[Id] = [h].[Id]
   LEFT JOIN [Pets] AS [p] ON [a].[Id] = [p].[Id]
   LEFT JOIN [Cats] AS [c] ON [a].[Id] = [c].[Id]
   LEFT JOIN [Dogs] AS [d] ON [a].[Id] = [d].[Id]
   ```

2. TPT SQL returning entities from a subset of types in the hierarchy:

   ```sql
   SELECT [a].[Id], [a].[FoodId], [a].[Name], [p].[Vet], [c].[EducationLevel], [d].[FavoriteToy], CASE
       WHEN [d].[Id] IS NOT NULL THEN N'Dog'
       WHEN [c].[Id] IS NOT NULL THEN N'Cat'
   END AS [Discriminator]
   FROM [Animals] AS [a]
   INNER JOIN [Pets] AS [p] ON [a].[Id] = [p].[Id]
   LEFT JOIN [Cats] AS [c] ON [a].[Id] = [c].[Id]
   LEFT JOIN [Dogs] AS [d] ON [a].[Id] = [d].[Id]
   ```

3. TPT SQL returning only entities from a single leaf type in the hierarchy:

   ```sql
   SELECT [a].[Id], [a].[FoodId], [a].[Name], [p].[Vet], [c].[EducationLevel]
   FROM [Animals] AS [a]
   INNER JOIN [Pets] AS [p] ON [a].[Id] = [p].[Id]
   INNER JOIN [Cats] AS [c] ON [a].[Id] = [c].[Id]
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> EF Core uses “discriminator synthesis” to determine which table the data comes from, and hence the correct type to use. This works because the LEFT JOIN returns nulls for the dependent ID column (the “sub-tables”) which aren’t the correct type. So for a dog, `[d].[Id]` will be non-null, and all the other (concrete) IDs will be null.

All of these queries can suffer from performance issues due to the table joins. This is why TPT is never a good choice for query performance.

#### TPC queries

TPC improves over TPT for all of these queries because the number of tables that need to be queried is reduced. In addition, the results from each table are combined using `UNION ALL`, which can be considerably faster than a table join, since it does not need to perform any matching between rows or de-duplication of rows.

1. TPC SQL returning entities of all types in the hierarchy:

   ```sql
   SELECT [f].[Id], [f].[FoodId], [f].[Name], [f].[Species], [f].[Value], NULL AS [FavoriteAnimalId], NULL AS [Vet], NULL AS [EducationLevel], NULL AS [FavoriteToy], N'FarmAnimal' AS [Discriminator]
   FROM [FarmAnimals] AS [f]
   UNION ALL
   SELECT [h].[Id], [h].[FoodId], [h].[Name], NULL AS [Species], NULL AS [Value], [h].[FavoriteAnimalId], NULL AS [Vet], NULL AS [EducationLevel], NULL AS [FavoriteToy], N'Human' AS [Discriminator]
   FROM [Humans] AS [h]
   UNION ALL
   SELECT [c].[Id], [c].[FoodId], [c].[Name], NULL AS [Species], NULL AS [Value], NULL AS [FavoriteAnimalId], [c].[Vet], [c].[EducationLevel], NULL AS [FavoriteToy], N'Cat' AS [Discriminator]
   FROM [Cats] AS [c]
   UNION ALL
   SELECT [d].[Id], [d].[FoodId], [d].[Name], NULL AS [Species], NULL AS [Value], NULL AS [FavoriteAnimalId], [d].[Vet], NULL AS [EducationLevel], [d].[FavoriteToy], N'Dog' AS [Discriminator]
   FROM [Dogs] AS [d]
   ```

2. TPC SQL returning entities from a subset of types in the hierarchy:

   ```sql
   SELECT [c].[Id], [c].[FoodId], [c].[Name], [c].[Vet], [c].[EducationLevel], NULL AS [FavoriteToy], N'Cat' AS [Discriminator]
   FROM [Cats] AS [c]
   UNION ALL
   SELECT [d].[Id], [d].[FoodId], [d].[Name], [d].[Vet], NULL AS [EducationLevel], [d].[FavoriteToy], N'Dog' AS [Discriminator]
   FROM [Dogs] AS [d]
   ```

3. TPC SQL returning only entities from a single leaf type in the hierarchy:

   ```sql
   SELECT [c].[Id], [c].[FoodId], [c].[Name], [c].[Vet], [c].[EducationLevel]
   FROM [Cats] AS [c]
   ```

Even though TPC is better than TPT for all of these queries, the TPH queries are still better when returning instances of multiple types. This is one of the reasons that TPH is the default strategy used by EF Core.

As the SQL for query #3 shows, TPC really excels when querying for entities of a single leaf type. The query only uses a single table and needs no filtering.

### TPC inserts and updates

TPC also performs well when saving a new entity, since this requires inserting only a single row into a single table. This is also true for TPH. With TPT, rows must be inserted into many tables, which will perform less well.

The same is often true for updates, although in this case if all columns being updated are in the same table, even for TPT, then the difference may not be significant.

### Space considerations

Both TPT and TPC can use less storage than TPH when there are many subtypes with many properties that are often not used. This is because every row in the TPH table must store a `NULL` for each of these unused properties. In practice, this is rarely an issue, but it could be worth considering when storing large amounts of data with these characteristics.

> [!TIP]
> If your database system supports it (e.g. SQL Server), then consider using "sparse columns" for TPH columns that will be rarely populated.

### Key generation

The inheritance mapping strategy chosen has consequences for how primary key values are generated and managed. Keys in TPH are easy, since each entity instance is represented by a single row in a single table. Any kind of key value generation can be used, and no additional constraints are needed.

For the TPT strategy, there is always a row in the table mapped to the base type of the hierarchy. Any kind of key generation can be used on this row, and the keys for other tables are linked to this table using foreign key constraints.

Things get a bit more complicated for TPC. First, it’s important to understand that EF Core requires that all entities in a hierarchy must have a unique key value, even if the entities have different types. So, using our example model, a Dog cannot have the same Id key value as a Cat. Second, unlike TPT, there is no common table that can act as the single place where key values live and can be generated. This means a simple `Identity` column cannot be used.

For databases that support sequences, key values can be generated by using a single sequence referenced in the default constraint for each table. This is the strategy used in the TPC tables shown above, where each table has the following:

```sql
[Id] int NOT NULL DEFAULT (NEXT VALUE FOR [AnimalSequence])
```

`AnimalSequence` is a database sequence created by EF Core. This strategy is used by default for TPC hierarchies when using the EF Core database provider for SQL Server. Database providers for other databases that support sequences should have a similar default. Other key generation strategies that use sequences, such as Hi-Lo patterns, may also be used with TPC.

While standard Identity columns will not work with TPC, it is possible to use Identity columns if each table is configured with an appropriate seed and increment such that the values generated for each table will never conflict. For example:

<!--
            modelBuilder.Entity<Cat>().ToTable("Cats", tb => tb.Property(e => e.Id).UseIdentityColumn(1, 4));
            modelBuilder.Entity<Dog>().ToTable("Dogs", tb => tb.Property(e => e.Id).UseIdentityColumn(2, 4));
            modelBuilder.Entity<FarmAnimal>().ToTable("FarmAnimals", tb => tb.Property(e => e.Id).UseIdentityColumn(3, 4));
            modelBuilder.Entity<Human>().ToTable("Humans", tb => tb.Property(e => e.Id).UseIdentityColumn(4, 4));
-->
[!code-csharp[UsingIdentity](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/TpcInheritanceSample.cs?name=UsingIdentity)]

SQLite does not support sequences or Identity seed/increment, and hence integer key value generation is not supported when using SQLite with the TPC strategy. However, client-side generation or globally unique keys--for example, GUID keys--are supported on any database, including SQLite.

### Foreign key constraints

The TPC mapping strategy creates a denormalized SQL schema--this is one reason why some database purists are against it. For example, consider the foreign key column `FavoriteAnimalId`. The value in this column must match the primary key value of some animal. This can be enforced in the database with a simple FK constraint when using TPH or TPT. For example:

```sql
CONSTRAINT [FK_Animals_Animals_FavoriteAnimalId] FOREIGN KEY ([FavoriteAnimalId]) REFERENCES [Animals] ([Id])
```

But when using TPC, the primary key for an animal is stored in the table for the concrete type of that animal. For example, a cat's primary key is stored in the `Cats.Id` column, while a dog's primary key is stored in the `Dogs.Id` column, and so on. This means an FK constraint cannot be created for this relationship.

In practice, this is not a problem as long as the application does not attempt to insert invalid data. For example, if all the data is inserted by EF Core and uses navigations to relate entities, then it is guaranteed that the FK column will contain valid PK value at all times.

### Summary and guidance

In summary, TPC is a good mapping strategy to use when your code will mostly query for entities of a single leaf type. This is because the storage requirements are smaller, and there is no discriminator column that may need an index. Inserts and updates are also efficient.

That being said, TPH is usually fine for most applications, and is a good default for a wide range of scenarios, so don't add the complexity of TPC if you don't need it. Specifically, if your code will mostly query for entities of many types, such as writing queries against the base type, then lean towards TPH over TPC.

Use TPT only if constrained to do so by external factors.

## Custom Reverse Engineering Templates

You can now customize the scaffolded code when reverse engineering an EF model from a database. Get started by adding the default templates to your project:

```dotnetcli
dotnet new install Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Templates::7.0.0-*
dotnet new ef-templates
```

The templates can then be customize and will automatically be used by `dotnet ef dbcontext scaffold` and `Scaffold-DbContext`.

For more details, see [Custom Reverse Engineering Templates](xref:core/managing-schemas/scaffolding/templates).

> [!TIP]
> The EF Team demonstrated and talked in depth about reverse engineering templates in an episode of the .NET Data Community Standup. As with [all Community Standup episodes](https://aka.ms/efstandups), you can [watch the T4 templates episode now on YouTube](https://youtu.be/x2nh1vZBsHE).

## Model building conventions

EF Core uses a metadata "model" to describe how the application's entity types are mapped to the underlying database. This model is built using a set of around 60 "conventions". The model built by conventions can then be customized using [mapping attributes (aka "data annotations")](xref:core/modeling/index#use-data-annotations-to-configure-a-model) and/or calls to the [`DbModelBuilder` API in `OnModelCreating`](xref:core/modeling/index#use-fluent-api-to-configure-a-model).

Starting with EF7, applications can now remove or replace any of these conventions, as well as add new conventions. Model building conventions are a powerful way to control the model configuration, but can be complex and hard to get right. In many case, the existing [pre-convention model configuration](xref:core/modeling/bulk-configuration) can be used instead to easily specify common configuration for properties and types.

Changes to the conventions used by a `DbContext` are made by overriding the `DbContext.ConfigureConventions` method. For example:

```csharp
protected override void ConfigureConventions(ModelConfigurationBuilder configurationBuilder)
{
    configurationBuilder.Conventions.Remove(typeof(ForeignKeyIndexConvention));
}
```

> [!TIP]
> To find all built-in model building conventions, look for every class that implements the <xref:Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Metadata.Conventions.IConvention> interface.

> [!TIP]
> The code shown here comes from [ModelBuildingConventionsSample.cs](https://github.com/dotnet/EntityFramework.Docs/tree/main/samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/ModelBuildingConventionsSample.cs).

### Removing an existing convention

Sometimes one of the built-in conventions may not appropriate for your application, in which case it can be removed.

#### Example: Don't create indexes for foreign key columns

It usually makes sense to create indexes for foreign key (FK) columns, and hence there is a built-in convention for this: <xref:Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Metadata.Conventions.ForeignKeyIndexConvention>. Looking at the model debug view for a `Post` entity type with relationships to `Blog` and `Author`, we can see two indexes are created--one for the `BlogId` FK, and the other for the `AuthorId` FK.

```text
  EntityType: Post
    Properties:
      Id (int) Required PK AfterSave:Throw ValueGenerated.OnAdd
      AuthorId (no field, int?) Shadow FK Index
      BlogId (no field, int) Shadow Required FK Index
    Navigations:
      Author (Author) ToPrincipal Author Inverse: Posts
      Blog (Blog) ToPrincipal Blog Inverse: Posts
    Keys:
      Id PK
    Foreign keys:
      Post {'AuthorId'} -> Author {'Id'} ToDependent: Posts ToPrincipal: Author ClientSetNull
      Post {'BlogId'} -> Blog {'Id'} ToDependent: Posts ToPrincipal: Blog Cascade
    Indexes:
      AuthorId
      BlogId
```

However, indexes have overhead, and, [as asked here](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/10855), it may not always be appropriate to create them for all FK columns. To achieve this, the `ForeignKeyIndexConvention` can be removed when building the model:

```csharp
protected override void ConfigureConventions(ModelConfigurationBuilder configurationBuilder)
{
    configurationBuilder.Conventions.Remove(typeof(ForeignKeyIndexConvention));
}
```

Looking at the debug view of the model for `Post` now, we see that the indexes on FKs have not been created:

```text
  EntityType: Post
    Properties:
      Id (int) Required PK AfterSave:Throw ValueGenerated.OnAdd
      AuthorId (no field, int?) Shadow FK
      BlogId (no field, int) Shadow Required FK
    Navigations:
      Author (Author) ToPrincipal Author Inverse: Posts
      Blog (Blog) ToPrincipal Blog Inverse: Posts
    Keys:
      Id PK
    Foreign keys:
      Post {'AuthorId'} -> Author {'Id'} ToDependent: Posts ToPrincipal: Author ClientSetNull
      Post {'BlogId'} -> Blog {'Id'} ToDependent: Posts ToPrincipal: Blog Cascade
```

When desired, indexes can still be explicitly created for foreign key columns, either using the <xref:Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.IndexAttribute>:

```csharp
[Index("BlogId")]
public class Post
{
    // ...
}
```

Or with configuration in `OnModelCreating`:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<Post>(entityTypeBuilder => entityTypeBuilder.HasIndex("BlogId"));
}
```

Looking at the `Post` entity type again, it now contains the `BlogId` index, but not the `AuthorId` index:

```text
  EntityType: Post
    Properties:
      Id (int) Required PK AfterSave:Throw ValueGenerated.OnAdd
      AuthorId (no field, int?) Shadow FK
      BlogId (no field, int) Shadow Required FK Index
    Navigations:
      Author (Author) ToPrincipal Author Inverse: Posts
      Blog (Blog) ToPrincipal Blog Inverse: Posts
    Keys:
      Id PK
    Foreign keys:
      Post {'AuthorId'} -> Author {'Id'} ToDependent: Posts ToPrincipal: Author ClientSetNull
      Post {'BlogId'} -> Blog {'Id'} ToDependent: Posts ToPrincipal: Blog Cascade
    Indexes:
      BlogId
```

> [!TIP]
> If your model doesn't use mapping attributes (aka data annotations) for configuration, then all conventions ending in `AttributeConvention` can be safely removed to speed up model building.

### Adding a new convention

Removing existing conventions is a start, but what about adding completely new model building conventions? EF7 supports this as well!

#### Example: Constrain length of discriminator properties

The [table-per-hierarchy inheritance mapping strategy](xref:core/modeling/inheritance) requires a discriminator column to specify which type is represented in any given row. By default, EF uses an unbounded string column for the discriminator, which ensures that it will work for any discriminator length. However, constraining the maximum length of discriminator strings can make for more efficient storage and queries. Let's create a new convention that will do that.

EF Core model building conventions are triggered based on changes being made to the model as it is being built. This keeps the model up-to-date as explicit configuration is made, mapping attributes are applied, and other conventions run. To participate in this, every convention implements one or more interfaces which determine when the convention will be triggered. For example, a convention that implements <xref:Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Metadata.Conventions.IEntityTypeAddedConvention> will be triggered whenever a new entity type is added to the model. Likewise, a convention that implements both <xref:Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Metadata.Conventions.IForeignKeyAddedConvention> and <xref:Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Metadata.Conventions.IKeyAddedConvention> will be triggered whenever either a key or a foreign key is added to the model.

Knowing which interfaces to implement can be tricky, since configuration made to the model at one point may be changed or removed at a later point. For example, a key may be created by convention, but then later replaced when a different key is configured explicitly.

Let's make this a bit more concrete by making a first attempt at implementing the discriminator-length convention:

<!--
public class DiscriminatorLengthConvention1 : IEntityTypeBaseTypeChangedConvention
{
    public void ProcessEntityTypeBaseTypeChanged(
        IConventionEntityTypeBuilder entityTypeBuilder,
        IConventionEntityType? newBaseType,
        IConventionEntityType? oldBaseType,
        IConventionContext<IConventionEntityType> context)
    {
        var discriminatorProperty = entityTypeBuilder.Metadata.FindDiscriminatorProperty();
        if (discriminatorProperty != null
            && discriminatorProperty.ClrType == typeof(string))
        {
            discriminatorProperty.Builder.HasMaxLength(24);
        }
    }
}
-->
[!code-csharp[DiscriminatorLengthConvention1](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/ModelBuildingConventionsSample.cs?name=DiscriminatorLengthConvention1)]

This convention implements <xref:Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Metadata.Conventions.IEntityTypeBaseTypeChangedConvention>, which means it will be triggered whenever the mapped inheritance hierarchy for an entity type is changed. The convention then finds and configures the string discriminator property for the hierarchy.

This convention is then used by calling `Add` in `ConfigureConventions`:

```csharp
protected override void ConfigureConventions(ModelConfigurationBuilder configurationBuilder)
{
    configurationBuilder.Conventions.Add(_ =>  new DiscriminatorLengthConvention1());
}
```

> [!TIP]
> Rather than adding an instance of the convention directly, the `Add` method accepts a factory for creating instances of the convention. This allows the convention to use dependencies from the EF Core internal service provider. Since this convention has no dependencies, the service provider parameter is named `_`, indicating that it is never used.

Building the model and looking at the `Post` entity type shows that this has worked--the discriminator property is now configured to with a maximum length of 24:

```text
 Discriminator (no field, string) Shadow Required AfterSave:Throw MaxLength(24)
```

But what happens if we now explicitly configure a different discriminator property? For example:

```csharp
modelBuilder.Entity<Post>()
    .HasDiscriminator<string>("PostTypeDiscriminator")
    .HasValue<Post>("Post")
    .HasValue<FeaturedPost>("Featured");
```

Looking at the debug view of the model, we find that the discriminator length is no longer configured!

```text
 PostTypeDiscriminator (no field, string) Shadow Required AfterSave:Throw
```

This is because the discriminator property that we configured in our convention was later removed when the custom discriminator was added. We could attempt to fix this by implementing another interface on our convention to react to the discriminator changes, but figuring out which interface to implement is not easy.

Fortunately, there is a different way to approach this that makes things much easier. A lot of the time, it doesn't matter what the model looks like while it is being built, as long as the final model is correct. In addition, the configuration we want to apply often does not need to trigger other conventions to react. Therefore, our convention can implement <xref:Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Metadata.Conventions.IModelFinalizingConvention>. Model finalizing conventions run after all other model building is complete, and so have access to the final state of the model. A model finalizing convention will typically iterate over the entire model configuring model elements as it goes. So, in this case, we will find every discriminator in the model and configure it:

<!--
public class DiscriminatorLengthConvention2 : IModelFinalizingConvention
{
    public void ProcessModelFinalizing(IConventionModelBuilder modelBuilder, IConventionContext<IConventionModelBuilder> context)
    {
        foreach (var entityType in modelBuilder.Metadata.GetEntityTypes()
                     .Where(entityType => entityType.BaseType == null))
        {
            var discriminatorProperty = entityType.FindDiscriminatorProperty();
            if (discriminatorProperty != null
                && discriminatorProperty.ClrType == typeof(string))
            {
                discriminatorProperty.Builder.HasMaxLength(24);
            }
        }
    }
}
-->
[!code-csharp[DiscriminatorLengthConvention2](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/ModelBuildingConventionsSample.cs?name=DiscriminatorLengthConvention2)]

After building the model with this new convention, we find that the discriminator length is now configured correctly even though it has been customized:

```text
PostTypeDiscriminator (no field, string) Shadow Required AfterSave:Throw MaxLength(24)
```

Just for fun, let's go one step further and configure the max length to be the length of the longest discriminator value.

<!--
public class DiscriminatorLengthConvention3 : IModelFinalizingConvention
{
    public void ProcessModelFinalizing(IConventionModelBuilder modelBuilder, IConventionContext<IConventionModelBuilder> context)
    {
        foreach (var entityType in modelBuilder.Metadata.GetEntityTypes()
                     .Where(entityType => entityType.BaseType == null))
        {
            var discriminatorProperty = entityType.FindDiscriminatorProperty();
            if (discriminatorProperty != null
                && discriminatorProperty.ClrType == typeof(string))
            {
                var maxDiscriminatorValueLength =
                    entityType.GetDerivedTypesInclusive().Select(e => ((string)e.GetDiscriminatorValue()!).Length).Max();

                discriminatorProperty.Builder.HasMaxLength(maxDiscriminatorValueLength);
            }
        }
    }
}
-->
[!code-csharp[DiscriminatorLengthConvention3](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/ModelBuildingConventionsSample.cs?name=DiscriminatorLengthConvention3)]

Now the discriminator column max length is 8, which is the length of "Featured", the longest discriminator value in use.

```text
PostTypeDiscriminator (no field, string) Shadow Required AfterSave:Throw MaxLength(8)
```

> [!TIP]
> You might be wondering if the convention should also create an index for the discriminator column. There is [a discussion about this on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/4030). The short answer is that sometimes an index might be useful, but most of the time it probably won't be. Therefore, it's best to create appropriate indexes here as needed, rather than have a convention to do it always. But if you disagree with this, then the convention above can easily be modified to create an index as well.

#### Example: Default length for all string properties

Let's look at another example where a finalizing convention can be used--this time, setting a default maximum length for _any_ string property, as [asked for on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/EntityFramework.Docs/issues/3756 ). The convention looks quite similar to the previous example:

<!--
public class MaxStringLengthConvention : IModelFinalizingConvention
{
    public void ProcessModelFinalizing(IConventionModelBuilder modelBuilder, IConventionContext<IConventionModelBuilder> context)
    {
        foreach (var property in modelBuilder.Metadata.GetEntityTypes()
                     .SelectMany(
                         entityType => entityType.GetDeclaredProperties()
                             .Where(
                                 property => property.ClrType == typeof(string))))
        {

        }
    }
}
-->
[!code-csharp[MaxStringLengthConvention](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/ModelBuildingConventionsSample.cs?name=MaxStringLengthConvention)]

This convention is pretty simple. It finds every string property in the model and sets its max length to 512. Looking in the debug view at the properties for `Post`, we see that all the string properties now have a max length of 512.

```text
EntityType: Post
  Properties:
    Id (int) Required PK AfterSave:Throw ValueGenerated.OnAdd
    AuthorId (no field, int?) Shadow FK Index
    BlogId (no field, int) Shadow Required FK Index
    Content (string) Required MaxLength(512)
    Discriminator (no field, string) Shadow Required AfterSave:Throw MaxLength(512)
    PublishedOn (DateTime) Required
    Title (string) Required MaxLength(512)
```

But the `Content` property should probably allow more than 512 characters, or all our posts will be pretty short! This can be done without changing our convention by explicitly configuring the max length for just this property, either using a mapping attribute:

```csharp
[MaxLength(4000)]
public string Content { get; set; }
```

Or with code in `OnModelCreating`:

```csharp
modelBuilder.Entity<Post>()
    .Property(post => post.Content)
    .HasMaxLength(4000);
```

Now all properties have a max length of 512, except `Content` which was explicitly configured with 4000:

```text
EntityType: Post
  Properties:
    Id (int) Required PK AfterSave:Throw ValueGenerated.OnAdd
    AuthorId (no field, int?) Shadow FK Index
    BlogId (no field, int) Shadow Required FK Index
    Content (string) Required MaxLength(4000)
    Discriminator (no field, string) Shadow Required AfterSave:Throw MaxLength(512)
    PublishedOn (DateTime) Required
    Title (string) Required MaxLength(512)
```

So why didn't our convention override the explicitly configured max length? The answer is that EF Core keeps track of how every piece of configuration was made. This is represented by the <xref:Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Metadata.ConfigurationSource> enum. The different kinds of configuration are:

- `Explicit`: The model element was explicitly configured in `OnModelCrating`
- `DataAnnotation`: The model element was configured using a mapping attribute (aka data annotation) on the CLR type
- `Convention`: The model element was configured by a model building convention

Conventions never override configuration marked as `DataAnnotation` or `Explicit`. This is achieved by using a "convention builder", for example, the <xref:Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Metadata.Builders.IConventionPropertyBuilder>, which is obtained from the <xref:Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Metadata.IConventionProperty.Builder> property. For example:

```csharp
property.Builder.HasMaxLength(512);
```

Calling `HasMaxLength` on the convention builder will only set the max length _if it was not already configured by a mapping attribute or in `OnModelCreating`_.

Builder methods like this also have a second parameter: `fromDataAnnotation`. Set this to `true` if the convention is making the configuration on behalf of a mapping attribute. For example:

```csharp
property.Builder.HasMaxLength(512, fromDataAnnotation: true);
```

This sets the `ConfigurationSource` to `DataAnnotation`, which means that the value can now be overridden by explicit mapping on `OnModelCreating`, but not by non-mapping attribute conventions.

Finally, before we leave this example, what happens if we use both the `MaxStringLengthConvention` and `DiscriminatorLengthConvention3` at the same time? The answer is that it depends which order they are added, since model finalizing conventions run in the order they are added. So if `MaxStringLengthConvention` is added last, then it will run last, and it will set the max length of the discriminator property to 512. Therefore, in this case, it is better to add `DiscriminatorLengthConvention3` last so that it can override the default max length for just discriminator properties, while leaving all other string properties as 512.

### Replacing an existing convention

Sometimes rather than removing an existing convention completely we instead want to replace it with a convention that does basically the same thing, but with changed behavior. This is useful because the existing convention will already implement the interfaces it needs so as to be triggered appropriately.

#### Example: Opt-in property mapping

EF Core maps all public read-write properties by convention. This [might not be appropriate](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/16009) for the way your entity types are defined. To change this, we can replace the `PropertyDiscoveryConvention` with our own implementation that doesn't map any property unless it is explicitly mapped in `OnModelCreating` or marked with a new attribute called `Persist`:

<!--
[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Property | AttributeTargets.Field)]
public sealed class PersistAttribute : Attribute
{
}
-->
[!code-csharp[PersistAttribute](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/ModelBuildingConventionsSample.cs?name=PersistAttribute)]

Here is the new convention:

<!--
public class AttributeBasedPropertyDiscoveryConvention : PropertyDiscoveryConvention
{
    public AttributeBasedPropertyDiscoveryConvention(ProviderConventionSetBuilderDependencies dependencies)
        : base(dependencies)
    {
    }

    public override void ProcessEntityTypeAdded(
        IConventionEntityTypeBuilder entityTypeBuilder,
        IConventionContext<IConventionEntityTypeBuilder> context)
        => Process(entityTypeBuilder);

    public override void ProcessEntityTypeBaseTypeChanged(
        IConventionEntityTypeBuilder entityTypeBuilder,
        IConventionEntityType? newBaseType,
        IConventionEntityType? oldBaseType,
        IConventionContext<IConventionEntityType> context)
    {
        if ((newBaseType == null
             || oldBaseType != null)
            && entityTypeBuilder.Metadata.BaseType == newBaseType)
        {
            Process(entityTypeBuilder);
        }
    }

    private void Process(IConventionEntityTypeBuilder entityTypeBuilder)
    {
        foreach (var memberInfo in GetRuntimeMembers())
        {
            if (Attribute.IsDefined(memberInfo, typeof(PersistAttribute), inherit: true))
            {
                entityTypeBuilder.Property(memberInfo);
            }
            else if (memberInfo is PropertyInfo propertyInfo
                     && Dependencies.TypeMappingSource.FindMapping(propertyInfo) != null)
            {
                entityTypeBuilder.Ignore(propertyInfo.Name);
            }
        }

        IEnumerable<MemberInfo> GetRuntimeMembers()
        {
            var clrType = entityTypeBuilder.Metadata.ClrType;

            foreach (var property in clrType.GetRuntimeProperties()
                         .Where(p => p.GetMethod != null && !p.GetMethod.IsStatic))
            {
                yield return property;
            }

            foreach (var property in clrType.GetRuntimeFields())
            {
                yield return property;
            }
        }
    }
}
-->
[!code-csharp[AttributeBasedPropertyDiscoveryConvention](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/ModelBuildingConventionsSample.cs?name=AttributeBasedPropertyDiscoveryConvention)]

> [!TIP]
> When replacing a built-in convention, the new convention implementation should inherit from the existing convention class. Note that some conventions have relational or provider-specific implementations, in which case the new convention implementation should inherit from the most specific existing convention class for the database provider in use.

The convention is then registered using the `Replace` method in `ConfigureConventions`:

<!--
    protected override void ConfigureConventions(ModelConfigurationBuilder configurationBuilder)
    {
        configurationBuilder.Conventions.Replace<PropertyDiscoveryConvention>(
            serviceProvider => new AttributeBasedPropertyDiscoveryConvention(
                serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<ProviderConventionSetBuilderDependencies>()));
    }
-->
[!code-csharp[ReplaceConvention](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/ModelBuildingConventionsSample.cs?name=ReplaceConvention)]

> [!TIP]
> This is a case where the existing convention has dependencies, represented by the `ProviderConventionSetBuilderDependencies` dependency object. These are obtained from the internal service provider using `GetRequiredService` and passed to the convention constructor.

This convention works by getting all readable properties and fields from the given entity type. If the member is attributed with `[Persist]`, then it is mapped by calling:

```csharp
entityTypeBuilder.Property(memberInfo);
```

On the other hand, if the member is a property that would otherwise have been mapped, then it is excluded from the model using:

```csharp
entityTypeBuilder.Ignore(propertyInfo.Name);
```

Notice that this convention allows fields to be mapped (in addition to propeties) so long as they are marked with `[Persist]`. This means we can use private fields as hidden keys in the model.

For example, consider the following entity types:

<!--
public class LaundryBasket
{
    [Persist] [Key]
    private readonly int _id;

    [Persist]
    public int TenantId { get; init; }

    public bool IsClean { get; set; }

    public List<Garment> Garments { get; } = new();
}

public class Garment
{
    public Garment(string name, string color)
    {
        Name = name;
        Color = color;
    }

    [Persist]
    [Key]
    private readonly int _id;

    [Persist]
    public int TenantId { get; init; }

    [Persist]
    public string Name { get; }

    [Persist]
    public string Color { get; }

    public bool IsClean { get; set; }

    public LaundryBasket? Basket { get; set; }
}
-->
[!code-csharp[LaundryBasket](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/ModelBuildingConventionsSample.cs?name=LaundryBasket)]

The model built from these entity types is:

```text
Model:
  EntityType: Garment
    Properties:
      _id (_id, int) Required PK AfterSave:Throw ValueGenerated.OnAdd
      Basket_id (no field, int?) Shadow FK Index
      Color (string) Required
      Name (string) Required
      TenantId (int) Required
    Navigations:
      Basket (LaundryBasket) ToPrincipal LaundryBasket Inverse: Garments
    Keys:
      _id PK
    Foreign keys:
      Garment {'Basket_id'} -> LaundryBasket {'_id'} ToDependent: Garments ToPrincipal: Basket ClientSetNull
    Indexes:
      Basket_id
  EntityType: LaundryBasket
    Properties:
      _id (_id, int) Required PK AfterSave:Throw ValueGenerated.OnAdd
      TenantId (int) Required
    Navigations:
      Garments (List<Garment>) Collection ToDependent Garment Inverse: Basket
    Keys:
      _id PK
```

Notice that normally, `IsClean` would have been mapped, but since it is not marked with `[Perist]` (presumably because cleanliness is not a persistent property of laundry), it is now treated as an un-mapped property.

> [!TIP]
> This convention could not be implemented as a model finalizing convention because mapping a property triggers many other conventions to run to further configure the mapped property.

## Stored procedure mapping

By default, EF Core generates insert, update, and delete commands that work directly with tables or updatable views. EF7 introduces support for mapping of these commands to stored procedures.

> [!TIP]
> EF Core has always supported querying via stored procedures. The new support in EF7 is explicitly about using stored procedures for inserts, updates, and deletes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Support for stored procedure mapping does not imply that stored procedures are recommended.

Stored procedures are mapped in `OnModelCreating` using `InsertUsingStoredProcedure`, `UpdateUsingStoredProcedure`, and `DeleteUsingStoredProcedure`. For example, to map stored procedures for a `Person` entity type:

<!--
            modelBuilder.Entity<Person>()
                .InsertUsingStoredProcedure(
                    "People_Insert",
                    storedProcedureBuilder =>
                    {
                        storedProcedureBuilder.HasParameter(a => a.Name);
                        storedProcedureBuilder.HasResultColumn(a => a.Id);
                    })
                .UpdateUsingStoredProcedure(
                    "People_Update",
                    storedProcedureBuilder =>
                    {
                        storedProcedureBuilder.HasOriginalValueParameter(person => person.Id);
                        storedProcedureBuilder.HasOriginalValueParameter(person => person.Name);
                        storedProcedureBuilder.HasParameter(person => person.Name);
                        storedProcedureBuilder.HasRowsAffectedResultColumn();
                    })
                .DeleteUsingStoredProcedure(
                    "People_Delete",
                    storedProcedureBuilder =>
                    {
                        storedProcedureBuilder.HasOriginalValueParameter(person => person.Id);
                        storedProcedureBuilder.HasOriginalValueParameter(person => person.Name);
                        storedProcedureBuilder.HasRowsAffectedResultColumn();
                    });
-->
[!code-csharp[PersonSprocs](../../../../samples/core/Miscellaneous/NewInEFCore7/DocumentsContext.cs?name=PersonSprocs)]

This configuration maps to the following stored procedures when using SQL Server:

**For inserts**

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[People_Insert]
    @Name [nvarchar](max)
AS
BEGIN
      INSERT INTO [People] ([Name])
      OUTPUT INSERTED.[Id]
      VALUES (@Name);
END
```

**For updates**

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[People_Update]
    @Id [int],
    @Name_Original [nvarchar](max),
    @Name [nvarchar](max)
AS
BEGIN
    UPDATE [People] SET [Name] = @Name
    WHERE [Id] = @Id AND [Name] = @Name_Original
    SELECT @@ROWCOUNT
END
```

**For deletes**

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[People_Delete]
    @Id [int],
    @Name_Original [nvarchar](max)
AS
BEGIN
    DELETE FROM [People]
    OUTPUT 1
    WHERE [Id] = @Id AND [Name] = @Name_Original;
END
```

> [!TIP]
> Stored procedures do not need to be used for every type in the model, or for all operations on a given type. For example, if only `DeleteUsingStoredProcedure` is specified for a given type, then EF Core will generate SQL as normal for insert and update operations and only use the stored procedure for deletes.

The first argument passed to each method is the stored procedure name. This can be omitted, in which case EF Core will use the table name appended with "_Insert", "_Update", or "_Delete". So, in the example above, since the table is called "People", the stored procedure names can be removed with no change in functionality.

The second argument is a builder used to configure the input and output of the stored procedure, including parameters, return values, and result columns.

### Parameters

Parameters must be added to the builder in the same order as they appear in the stored procedure definition.

> [!NOTE]
> Parameters can be named, but EF Core always calls stored procedures using positional arguments rather than named arguments. Vote for [Allow configuring sproc mapping to use parameter names for invocation](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/28439) if calling by name is something you are interested in.

The first argument to each parameter builder method specifies the property in the model to which the parameter is bound. This can be a lambda expression:

```csharp
storedProcedureBuilder.HasParameter(a => a.Name);
```

Or a string, which is particularly useful when mapping [shadow properties](xref:core/modeling/shadow-properties):

```csharp
storedProcedureBuilder.HasParameter("Name");
```

Parameters are, by default, configured for "input". "Output" or "input/output" parameters can be configured using a nested builder. For example:

```csharp
storedProcedureBuilder.HasParameter(
    document => document.RetrievedOn, 
    parameterBuilder => parameterBuilder.IsOutput());
```

There are three different builder methods for different flavors of parameters:

- `HasParameter` specifies a normal parameter bound to the current value of the given property.
- `HasOriginalValueParameter` specifies a parameter bound to the original value of the given property. The original value is the value that the property had when it was queried from the database, if known. If this value is not known, then the current value is used instead. Original value parameters are useful for concurrency tokens.
- `HasRowsAffectedParameter` specifies a parameter used to return the number of rows affected by the stored procedure.

> [!TIP]
> Original value parameters must be used for key values in "update" and "delete" stored procedures. This ensures that correct row will be updated in future versions of EF Core that support mutable key values.

### Returning values

EF Core supports three mechanisms for returning values from stored procedures:

- Output parameters, as shown above.
- Result columns, which are specified using the `HasResultColumn` builder method.
- The return value, which is limited to returning the number of rows affected, and is specified using the `HasRowsAffectedReturnValue` builder method.

Values returned from stored procedures are often used for generated, default, or computed values, such as from an `Identity` key or a computed column. For example, the following configuration specifies four result columns:

```csharp
entityTypeBuilder.InsertUsingStoredProcedure(
        storedProcedureBuilder =>
        {
            storedProcedureBuilder.HasParameter(document => document.Title);
            storedProcedureBuilder.HasResultColumn(document => document.Id);
            storedProcedureBuilder.HasResultColumn(document => document.FirstRecordedOn);
            storedProcedureBuilder.HasResultColumn(document => document.RetrievedOn);
            storedProcedureBuilder.HasResultColumn(document => document.RowVersion);
        });
```

These are used to return:

- The generated key value for the `Id` property.
- The default value generated by the database for the `FirstRecordedOn` property.
- The computed value generated by the database for the `RetrievedOn` property.
- The automatically generated `rowversion` concurrency token for the `RowVersion` property.

This configuration maps to the following stored procedure when using SQL Server:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[Documents_Insert]
    @Title [nvarchar](max)
AS
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO [Documents] ([Title])
    OUTPUT INSERTED.[Id], INSERTED.[FirstRecordedOn], INSERTED.[RetrievedOn], INSERTED.[RowVersion]
    VALUES (@Title);
END
```

### Optimistic concurrency

[Optimistic concurrency](xref:core/saving/concurrency) works the same way with stored procedures as it does without. The stored procedure should:

- Use a concurrency token in a `WHERE` clause to ensure that the row is only updated if it has a valid token. The value used for the concurrency token is typically, but does not have to be, the original value of the concurrency token property.
- Return the number of rows affected so that EF Core can compare this against the expected number of rows affected and throw a `DbUpdateConcurrencyException` if the values do not match.

For example, the following SQL Server stored procedure uses a `rowversion` automatic concurrency token:

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE [dbo].[Documents_Update]
    @Id [int],
    @RowVersion_Original [rowversion],
    @Title [nvarchar](max),
    @RowVersion [rowversion] OUT
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @TempTable table ([RowVersion] varbinary(8));
    UPDATE [Documents] SET
        [Title] = @Title
    OUTPUT INSERTED.[RowVersion] INTO @TempTable
    WHERE [Id] = @Id AND [RowVersion] = @RowVersion_Original
    SELECT @@ROWCOUNT;
    SELECT @RowVersion = [RowVersion] FROM @TempTable;
END
```

This is configured in EF Core using:

```csharp
.UpdateUsingStoredProcedure(
    storedProcedureBuilder =>
    {
        storedProcedureBuilder.HasOriginalValueParameter(document => document.Id);
        storedProcedureBuilder.HasOriginalValueParameter(document => document.RowVersion);
        storedProcedureBuilder.HasParameter(document => document.Title);
        storedProcedureBuilder.HasParameter(document => document.RowVersion, parameterBuilder => parameterBuilder.IsOutput());
        storedProcedureBuilder.HasRowsAffectedResultColumn();
    });
```

Notice that:

- The original value of the `RowVersion` concurrency token is used.
- The stored procedure uses a `WHERE` clause to ensure that the row is only updated if the `RowVersion` original value matches.
- The new generated value for the `RowVersion` is inserted into a temporary table.
- The number of rows affected (`@@ROWCOUNT`) and the generated `RowVersion` value are returned.

### Mapping inheritance hierarchies to stored procedures

EF Core requires that stored procedures follow the table layout for [types in a hierarchy](xref:core/modeling/inheritance). This means that:

- A hierarchy mapped using TPH must have a single insert, update, and/or delete stored procedure targeting the single mapped table. The insert and update stored procedures must have a parameter for the discriminator value.
- A hierarchy mapped using TPT must have an insert, update, and/or delete stored procedure for every type, including abstract types. EF Core will make multiple calls as needed to update, insert, and delete rows in all tables.
- A hierarchy mapped using TPC must have an insert, update, and/or delete stored procedure for every concrete type, but not abstract types.

> [!NOTE]
> If using a single stored procedure per concrete type regardless of the mapping strategy is something you are interested in, then vote for [Support using a single sproc per concrete type regardless of the inheritance mapping strategy](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/29143).

### Mapping owned types to stored procedures

Configuration of stored procedures for owned types is done in the nested owned type builder. For example:

```csharp
modelBuilder.Entity<Person>(
    entityTypeBuilder =>
    {
        entityTypeBuilder.OwnsOne(
            author => author.Contact,
            ownedNavigationBuilder =>
            {
                ownedNavigationBuilder.ToTable("Contacts");
                ownedNavigationBuilder
                    .InsertUsingStoredProcedure(
                        storedProcedureBuilder =>
                        {
                            storedProcedureBuilder.HasParameter("PersonId");
                            storedProcedureBuilder.HasParameter(contactDetails => contactDetails.Phone);
                        })
                    .UpdateUsingStoredProcedure(
                        storedProcedureBuilder =>
                        {
                            storedProcedureBuilder.HasOriginalValueParameter("PersonId");
                            storedProcedureBuilder.HasParameter(contactDetails => contactDetails.Phone);
                            storedProcedureBuilder.HasRowsAffectedResultColumn();
                        })
                    .DeleteUsingStoredProcedure(
                        storedProcedureBuilder =>
                        {
                            storedProcedureBuilder.HasOriginalValueParameter("PersonId");
                            storedProcedureBuilder.HasRowsAffectedResultColumn();
            });
    });
```

> [!NOTE]
> Currently stored procedures for insert, update, and delete only support owned types must be mapped to separate tables. That is, the owned type cannot be represented by columns in the owner table. Vote for [Add "table" splitting support to CUD sproc mapping](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/28434) if this is a limitation that you would like to see removed.

### Mapping many-to-many join entities to stored procedures

Configuration of stored procedures many-to-many join entities can be performed as part of the many-to-many configuration. For example:

<!--
            modelBuilder.Entity<Book>(
                entityTypeBuilder =>
                {
                    entityTypeBuilder
                        .HasMany(document => document.Authors)
                        .WithMany(author => author.PublishedWorks)
                        .UsingEntity<Dictionary<string, object>>(
                            "BookPerson",
                            builder => builder.HasOne<Person>().WithMany().OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.Cascade),
                            builder => builder.HasOne<Book>().WithMany().OnDelete(DeleteBehavior.ClientCascade),
                            joinTypeBuilder =>
