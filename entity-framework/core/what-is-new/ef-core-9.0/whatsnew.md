# What's New in EF Core 9

EF Core 9 (EF9) is the next release after EF Core 8 and is scheduled for release in November 2024. See [_Plan for Entity Framework Core 9_](xref:core/what-is-new/ef-core-9.0/plan) for details.

EF9 is available as [daily builds](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/blob/main/docs/DailyBuilds.md) which contain all the latest EF9 features and API tweaks. The samples here make use of these daily builds.

> [!TIP]
> You can run and debug into the samples by [downloading the sample code from GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/EntityFramework.Docs). Each section links to the source code specific to that section.

EF9 targets .NET 8, and can therefore be used with either [.NET 8 (LTS)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0) or [.NET 9](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/9.0).
