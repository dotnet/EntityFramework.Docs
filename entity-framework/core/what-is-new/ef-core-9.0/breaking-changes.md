# Breaking changes in EF Core 9 (EF9)

This page documents API and behavior changes that have the potential to break existing applications updating from EF Core 8 to EF Core 9. Make sure to review earlier breaking changes if updating from an earlier version of EF Core:

- [Breaking changes in EF Core 8](xref:core/what-is-new/ef-core-8.0/breaking-changes)
- [Breaking changes in EF Core 7](xref:core/what-is-new/ef-core-7.0/breaking-changes)
- [Breaking changes in EF Core 6](xref:core/what-is-new/ef-core-6.0/breaking-changes)

## Target Framework

EF Core 9 targets .NET 8. This means that existing applications that target .NET 8 can continue to do so. Applications targeting older .NET, .NET Core, and .NET Framework versions will need to target .NET 8 or .NET 9 to use EF Core 9.
