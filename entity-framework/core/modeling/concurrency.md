# Concurrency Tokens

> [!NOTE]
> This page documents how to configure concurrency tokens. See [Handling Concurrency Conflicts](xref:core/saving/concurrency) for a detailed explanation of how concurrency control works on EF Core and examples of how to handle concurrency conflicts in your application.

Properties configured as concurrency tokens are used to implement optimistic concurrency control.

## Configuration

### [Data Annotations](#tab/data-annotations)

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../samples/core/Modeling/ConcurrencyTokens/DataAnnotations/Concurrency.cs?name=Concurrency&highlight=5)]

### [Fluent API](#tab/fluent-api)

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../samples/core/Modeling/ConcurrencyTokens/FluentAPI/Concurrency.cs?name=Concurrency&highlight=5)]

## Timestamp/rowversion

A timestamp/rowversion is a property for which a new value is automatically generated by the database every time a row is inserted or updated. The property is also treated as a concurrency token, ensuring that you get an exception if a row you are updating has changed since you queried it. The precise details depend on the database provider being used; for SQL Server, a *byte[]* property is usually used, which will be set up as a *ROWVERSION* column in the database.

You can configure a property to be a timestamp/rowversion as follows:

### [Data Annotations](#tab/data-annotations)

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../samples/core/Modeling/ConcurrencyTokens/DataAnnotations/Timestamp.cs?name=Timestamp&highlight=7)]

### [Fluent API](#tab/fluent-api)

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../samples/core/Modeling/ConcurrencyTokens/FluentAPI/Timestamp.cs?name=Timestamp&highlight=9,17)]
