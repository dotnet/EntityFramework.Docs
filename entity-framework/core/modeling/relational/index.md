# Relational Database Modeling

> [!NOTE]
> This documentation is for EF Core. For EF6.x, see [Entity Framework 6](../../../ef6/index.md).

The configuration in this section is applicable to relational databases in general. The extension methods shown here will become available when you install a relational database provider (due to the shared *Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational* package).
