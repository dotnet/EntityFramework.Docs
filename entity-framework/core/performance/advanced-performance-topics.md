# Advanced Performance Topics

## DbContext pooling

A `DbContext` is generally a light object: creating and disposing one doesn't involve a database operation, and most applications can do so without any noticeable impact on performance. However, each `DbContext` does set up a various internal services and objects necessary for performing its duties, and the overhead of continuously doing so may be significant in high-performance scenarios. For these cases, EF Core can *pool* your `DbContext` instances: when you dispose your `DbContext`, EF Core resets its state and stores it in an internal pool; when a new instance is next requested, that pooled instance is returned instead of setting up a new one. `DbContext` pooling allows you to pay `DbContext` setup costs only once at program startup, rather than continuously.

Following are the benchmark results for fetching a single row from a SQL Server database running locally on the same machine, with and without `DbContext` pooling. As always, results will change with the number of rows, the latency to your database server and other factors. Importantly, this benchmarks single-threaded pooling performance, while a real-world contended scenario may have different results; benchmark on your platform before making any decisions. [The source code is available here](https://github.com/dotnet/EntityFramework.Docs/tree/main/samples/core/Benchmarks/ContextPooling.cs), feel free to use it as a basis for your own measurements.

|                Method | NumBlogs |     Mean |    Error |   StdDev |   Gen 0 | Gen 1 | Gen 2 | Allocated |
|---------------------- |--------- |---------:|---------:|---------:|--------:|------:|------:|----------:|
| WithoutContextPooling |        1 | 701.6 us | 26.62 us | 78.48 us | 11.7188 |     - |     - |  50.38 KB |
|    WithContextPooling |        1 | 350.1 us |  6.80 us | 14.64 us |  0.9766 |     - |     - |   4.63 KB |

Note that `DbContext` pooling is orthogonal to database connection pooling, which is managed at a lower level in the database driver.

### [With dependency injection](#tab/with-di)

The typical pattern in an ASP.NET Core app using EF Core involves registering a custom <xref:Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.DbContext> type into the [dependency injection](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection) container via <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.EntityFrameworkServiceCollectionExtensions.AddDbContext%2A>. Then, instances of that type are obtained through constructor parameters in controllers or Razor Pages.

To enable `DbContext` pooling, simply replace `AddDbContext` with <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.EntityFrameworkServiceCollectionExtensions.AddDbContextPool%2A>:

```csharp
services.AddDbContextPool<BloggingContext>(
    options => options.UseSqlServer(connectionString));
```

The `poolSize` parameter of <xref:Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.EntityFrameworkServiceCollectionExtensions.AddDbContextPool%2A> sets the maximum number of instances retained by the pool (defaults to 1024 in EF Core 6.0, and to 128 in previous versions). Once `poolSize` is exceeded, new context instances are not cached and EF falls back to the non-pooling behavior of creating instances on demand.

### [Without dependency injection](#tab/without-di)

> [!NOTE]
> Pooling without dependency injection was introduced in EF Core 6.0.

To use `DbContext` pooling without dependency injection, initialize a `PooledDbContextFactory` and request context instances from it:

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../samples/core/Performance/Program.cs#DbContextPoolingWithoutDI)]

The `poolSize` parameter of the `PooledDbContextFactory` constructor sets the maximum number of instances retained by the pool (defaults to 1024 in EF Core 6.0, and to 128 in previous versions). Once `poolSize` is exceeded, new context instances are not cached and EF falls back to the non-pooling behavior of creating instances on demand.

### Limitations

`DbContext` pooling has a few limitations on what can be done in the `OnConfiguring` method of the context.

> [!WARNING]
> Avoid using context pooling in apps that maintain state. For example, private fields in the context that shouldn't be shared across requests. EF Core only resets the state that it is aware of before adding a context instance to the pool.

Context pooling works by reusing the same context instance across requests. This means that it's effectively registered as a [Singleton](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection#service-lifetimes) in terms of the instance itself so that it's able to persist.

Context pooling is intended for scenarios where the context configuration, which includes services resolved, is fixed between requests. For cases where [Scoped](/aspnet/core/fundamentals/dependency-injection#service-lifetimes) services are required, or configuration needs to be changed, don't use pooling.

## Query caching and parameterization

When EF receives a LINQ query tree for execution, it must first "compile" that tree into a SQL query. Because this is a heavy process, EF caches queries by the query tree *shape*: queries with the same structure reuse internally-cached compilation outputs, and can skip repeated compilation. The different queries may still reference different *values*, but as long as these values are properly parameterized, the structure is the same and caching will function properly.

Consider the following two queries:

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../samples/core/Performance/Program.cs#QueriesWithConstants)]

Since the expression trees contains different constants, the expression tree differs and each of these queries will be compiled separately by EF Core. In addition, each query produces a slightly different SQL command:

```sql
SELECT TOP(1) [b].[Id], [b].[Name]
FROM [Blogs] AS [b]
WHERE [b].[Name] = N'blog1'

SELECT TOP(1) [b].[Id], [b].[Name]
FROM [Blogs] AS [b]
WHERE [b].[Name] = N'blog2'
```

Because the SQL differs, your database server will likely also need to produce a query plan for both queries, rather than reusing the same plan.

A small modification to your queries can change things considerably:

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../samples/core/Performance/Program.cs#QueriesWithParameterization)]

Since the blog name is now *parameterized*, both queries have the same tree shape, and EF only needs to be compiled once. The SQL produced is also parameterized, allowing the database to reuse the same query plan:

```sql
SELECT TOP(1) [b].[Id], [b].[Name]
FROM [Blogs] AS [b]
WHERE [b].[Name] = @__blogName_0
```

Note that there is no need to parameterize each and every query: it's perfectly fine to have some queries with constants, and indeed, databases (and EF) can sometimes perform certain optimization around constants which aren't possible when the query is parameterized. See the section on [dynamically-constructed queries](#dynamically-constructed-queries) for an example where proper parameterization is crucial.

> [!NOTE]
> EF Core's [event counters](xref:core/logging-events-diagnostics/event-counters) report the Query Cache Hit Rate. In a normal application, this counter reaches 100% soon after program startup, once most queries have executed at least once. If this counter remains stable below 100%, that is an indication that your application may be doing something which defeats the query cache - it's a good idea to investigate that.

> [!NOTE]
> How the database manages caches query plans is database-dependent. For example, SQL Server implicitly maintains an LRU query plan cache, whereas PostgreSQL does not (but prepared statements can produce a very similar end effect). Consult your database documentation for more details.

## Dynamically-constructed queries

In some situations, it is necessary to dynamically construct LINQ queries rather than specifying them outright in source code. This can happen, for example, in a website which receives arbitrary query details from a client, with open-ended query operators (sorting, filtering, paging...). In principle, if done correctly, dynamically-constructed queries can be just as efficient as regular ones (although it's not possible to use the compiled query optimization with dynamic queries). In practice, however, they are frequently the source of performance issues, since it's easy to accidentally produce expression trees with shapes that differ every time.

The following example uses two techniques to dynamically construct a query; we add a `Where` operator to the query only if the given parameter is not null. Note that this isn't a good use case for dynamically constructing a query - but we're using it for simplicity:

### [With constant](#tab/with-constant)

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../samples/core/Benchmarks/DynamicallyConstructedQueries.cs?name=WithConstant&highlight=14-24)]

### [With parameter](#tab/with-parameter)

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../samples/core/Benchmarks/DynamicallyConstructedQueries.cs?name=WithParameter&highlight=14)]

***

Benchmarking these two techniques gives the following results:

|        Method |       Mean |    Error |    StdDev |   Gen 0 |  Gen 1 | Gen 2 | Allocated |
|-------------- |-----------:|---------:|----------:|--------:|-------:|------:|----------:|
|  WithConstant | 1,096.7 us | 12.54 us |  11.12 us | 13.6719 | 1.9531 |     - |  83.91 KB |
| WithParameter |   570.8 us | 42.43 us | 124.43 us |  5.8594 |      - |     - |  37.16 KB |

Even if the sub-millisecond difference seems small, keep in mind that the constant version continuously pollutes the cache and causes other queries to be re-compiled, slowing them down as well.

> [!NOTE]
> Avoid constructing queries with the expression tree API unless you really need to. Aside from the API's complexity, it's very easy to inadvertently cause significant performance issues when using them.

## Reducing runtime overhead

As with any layer, EF Core adds a bit of runtime overhead compared to coding directly against lower-level database APIs. This runtime overhead is unlikely to impact most real-world applications in a significant way; the other topics in this performance guide, such as query efficiency, index usage and minimizing roundtrips, are far more important. In addition, even for highly-optimized applications, network latency and database I/O will usually dominate any time spent inside EF Core itself. However, for high-performance, low-latency applications where every bit of perf is important, the following recommendations can be used to reduce EF Core overhead to a minimum:

* Turn on [DbContext pooling](#dbcontext-pooling); our benchmarks show that this feature can have a decisive impact on high-perf, low-latency applications.
  * Make sure that the `maxPoolSize` corresponds to your usage scenario; if it is too low, DbContext instances will be constantly created and disposed, degrading performance. Setting it too high may needlessly consume memory as unused DbContext instances are maintained in the pool.
  * For an extra tiny perf boost, consider using `PooledDbContextFactory` instead of having DI inject context instances directly (EF Core 6 and above). DI management of DbContext pooling incurs a slight overhead.
* Use precompiled queries for hot queries.
  * The more complex the LINQ query - the more operators it contains and the bigger the resulting expression tree - the more gains can be expected from using compiled queries.
* Consider disabling thread safety checks by setting `EnableThreadSafetyChecks` to false in your context configuration (EF Core 6 and above).
  * Using the same DbContext instance concurrently from different threads isn't supported. EF Core has a safety feature which detects this programming bug in many cases (but not all), and immediately throws an informative exception. However, this safety feature adds some runtime overhead.
  * **WARNING:** Only disable thread safety checks after thoroughly testing that your application doesn't contain such concurrency bugs.
