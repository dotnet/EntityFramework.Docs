# Installing EF Core

The recommended way to add EF Core runtime libraries into an application is to install a an EF Core database provider from NuGet.

> [!TIP]  
> If you need to update an application that is using a third-party database provider, always check for an update of the provider that is compatible with the version of EF Core you want to use. Database providers for previous versions are not compatible with version 2.0 of the EF Core runtime.  

Besides the runtime libraries, you can install tools which make it easier to perform several EF Core-related tasks in your project at design time, such as creating and applying migrations, and creating a model based on an existing database.

> [!TIP]  
> Applications targeting ASP.NET Core 2.0 can use EF Core 2.0 without additional dependencies besides third party database providers. Applications targeting previous versions of ASP.NET Core need to upgrade to ASP.NET Core 2.0 in order to use EF Core 2.0.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Always use versions of the tools packages that match the major version of the runtime packages.

## Cross-platform development using the .NET Core Command Line Interface (CLI)

To develop applications that target [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core) you can choose to use the [`dotnet` CLI commands](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/) in combination with your favorite text editor, or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio, Visual Studio for Mac or Visual Studio Code.

To install or upgrade the SQL Server provider in a cross-platform .NET Core application, switch to the application's directory and run the following in a command line:

``` shell
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
```

You can indicate a specific version install in the `dotnet add package` command, using the `-v` modifier. E.g. to install EF Core 2.0 packages, append `-v 2.0.0` to the command.

EF Core includes a set of [additional commands for the `dotnet` CLI](../../miscellaneous/cli/dotnet.md), starting with `dotnet ef`. In order to use the `dotnet ef` CLI commands, your application’s `.csproj` file needs to contain the following entry:

``` xml
<ItemGroup>
  <DotNetCliToolReference
      Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools.DotNet"
      Version="2.0.0" />
</ItemGroup>
```

## Visual Studio development

You can develop many different types of applications that target .NET Core, .NET Framework, or other platforms supported by EF Core using Visual Studio. There are two ways you can install an EF Core database provider in your application from Visual Studio:

### Using NuGet's [Package Manager User Interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/tools/package-manager-ui)

* Select on the menu **Project > Manage NuGet Packages**

* Click on the **Browse** or the **Updates** tab

* Select the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer` package and the desired version and confirm

### Using NuGet's [Package Manager Console (PMC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/nuget/tools/package-manager-console)

* Select on the menu **Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console**

* Type and run the following command in the PMC:

  ``` powershell
  Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer
  ```
* You can use the `Update-Package` command instead to update a package that is already installed to a more recent  version

* To specify a specific version, you can use the `-Version` modifier, e.g. to install EF Core 2.0 packages, append `-Version 2.0.0` to the commands

### Tools

There is also a PowerShell version of the [EF Core commands which run inside the PMC](../../miscellaneous/cli/powershell.md) in Visual Studio, with similar capabilities to the `dotnet ef` commands. In order to use these, install the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools` package using either the Package Manager UI or the PMC.

> [!TIP]  
> Although it is possible to use the `dotnet ef` commands from the PMC in Visual Studio, it is far more convenient to use the PowerShell version:
> * They automatically work with the current project selected in the PMC without requiring manually switching directories.  
> * They automatically open files generated by the commands in Visual Studio after the command is completed.

## Deprecated packages

If you are upgrading an existing application, some references to older EF Core packages may need to be removed manually. In particular, data provider design-time packages such as `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer.Design` are no longer required or supported in EF Core 2.0, but will not be automatically removed when upgrading the other packages.
