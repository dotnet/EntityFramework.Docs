# Getting Started with EF Core on Universal Windows Platform (UWP)

These 101 tutorials require no previous knowledge of Entity Framework Core or Visual Studio. They will take you step-by-step through creating a simple Universal Window Platform (UWP) application that queries and saves data from a database.

You can find the UWP documentation at [developer.microsoft.com/windows/apps/develop](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/apps/develop).
