## Step-by-step Turorials

These 101 tutorials require no previous knowledge of Entity Framework (EF) or a particular IDE. They will take you step-by-step through creating a simple application that queries and saves data from a database. We have provided tutorials to get you started on various operating systems and application types.

Entity Framework can create a model based on an existing database, or create a database for you based on your model. There are tutorials that demonstrate both of these approaches.
