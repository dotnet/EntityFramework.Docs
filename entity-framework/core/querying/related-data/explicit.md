# Explicit Loading of Related Data

## Explicit loading

You can explicitly load a navigation property via the `DbContext.Entry(...)` API.

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../../samples/core/Querying/RelatedData/Program.cs#Explicit)]

You can also explicitly load a navigation property by executing a separate query that returns the related entities. If change tracking is enabled, then when query materializes an entity, EF Core will automatically set the navigation properties of the newly loaded entity to refer to any entities already loaded, and set the navigation properties of the already-loaded entities to refer to the newly loaded entity.

## Querying related entities

You can also get a LINQ query that represents the contents of a navigation property.

It allows you to apply other operators over the query. For example, applying an aggregate operator over the related entities without loading them into memory.

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../../samples/core/Querying/RelatedData/Program.cs#NavQueryAggregate)]

You can also filter which related entities are loaded into memory.
