# Loading Related Data

Entity Framework Core allows you to use the navigation properties in your model to load related entities. There are three common O/RM patterns used to load related data.

* **[Eager loading](xref:core/querying/related-data/eager)** means that the related data is loaded from the database as part of the initial query.
* **[Explicit loading](xref:core/querying/related-data/explicit)** means that the related data is explicitly loaded from the database at a later time.
* **[Lazy loading](xref:core/querying/related-data/lazy)** means that the related data is transparently loaded from the database when the navigation property is accessed.
