# Global Query Filters

Global query filters are LINQ query predicates applied to Entity Types in the metadata model (usually in `OnModelCreating`). A query predicate is a boolean expression typically passed to the LINQ `Where` query operator.  EF Core applies such filters automatically to any LINQ queries involving those Entity Types.  EF Core also applies them to Entity Types, referenced indirectly through use of Include or navigation property. Some common applications of this feature are:

* **Soft delete** - An Entity Type defines an `IsDeleted` property.
* **Multi-tenancy** - An Entity Type defines a `TenantId` property.

## Example

The following example shows how to use Global Query Filters to implement multi-tenancy and soft-delete query behaviors in a simple blogging model.

> [!TIP]
> You can view this article's [sample](https://github.com/dotnet/EntityFramework.Docs/tree/main/samples/core/Querying/QueryFilters) on GitHub.

> [!NOTE]
> Multi-tenancy is used here as a simple example. There is also an article with comprehensive guidance for [multi-tenancy in EF Core applications](xref:core/miscellaneous/multitenancy).

First, define the entities:

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../samples/core/Querying/QueryFilters/Entities.cs#Entities)]

Note the declaration of a `_tenantId` field on the `Blog` entity. This field will be used to associate each Blog instance with a specific tenant. Also defined is an `IsDeleted` property on the `Post` entity type. This property is used to keep track of whether a post instance has been "soft-deleted". That is, the instance is marked as deleted without physically removing the underlying data.

Next, configure the query filters in `OnModelCreating` using the `HasQueryFilter` API.

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../samples/core/Querying/QueryFilters/BloggingContext.cs#FilterConfiguration)]

The predicate expressions passed to the `HasQueryFilter` calls will now automatically be applied to any LINQ queries for those types.

> [!TIP]
> Note the use of a DbContext instance level field: `_tenantId` used to set the current tenant. Model-level filters will use the value from the correct context instance (that is, the instance that is executing the query).

> [!NOTE]
> It is currently not possible to define multiple query filters on the same entity - only the last one will be applied. However, you can define a single filter with multiple conditions using the logical `AND` operator ([`&&` in C#](/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/operators/boolean-logical-operators#conditional-logical-and-operator-)).

## Use of navigations

You can also use navigations in defining global query filters. Using navigations in query filter will cause query filters to be applied recursively. When EF Core expands navigations used in query filters, it will also apply query filters defined on referenced entities.

To illustrate this configure query filters in `OnModelCreating` in the following way:
[!code-csharp[Main](../../../samples/core/Querying/QueryFilters/FilteredBloggingContextRequired.cs#NavigationInFilter)]

Next, query for all `Blog` entities:
[!code-csharp[Main](../../../samples/core/Querying/QueryFilters/Program.cs#QueriesNavigation)]

This query produces the following SQL, which applies query filters defined for both `Blog` and `Post` entities:

```sql
SELECT [b].[BlogId], [b].[Name], [b].[Url]
FROM [Blogs] AS [b]
WHERE (
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM [Posts] AS [p]
    WHERE ([p].[Title] LIKE N'%fish%') AND ([b].[BlogId] = [p].[BlogId])) > 0
```

> [!NOTE]
> Currently EF Core does not detect cycles in global query filter definitions, so you should be careful when defining them. If specified incorrectly, cycles could lead to infinite loops during query translation.

## Accessing entity with query filter using required navigation

> [!CAUTION]
> Using required navigation to access entity which has global query filter defined may lead to unexpected results.

Required navigation expects the related entity to always be present. If necessary related entity is filtered out by the query filter, the parent entity wouldn't be in result either. So you may get fewer elements than expected in result.

To illustrate the problem, we can use the `Blog` and `Post` entities specified above and the following `OnModelCreating` method:

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../samples/core/Querying/QueryFilters/FilteredBloggingContextRequired.cs#IncorrectFilter)]

The model can be seeded with the following data:

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../samples/core/Querying/QueryFilters/Program.cs#SeedData)]

The problem can be observed when executing two queries:

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../samples/core/Querying/QueryFilters/Program.cs#Queries)]

With above setup, the first query returns all 6 `Post`s, however the second query only returns 3. This mismatch happens because `Include` method in the second query loads the related `Blog` entities. Since the navigation between `Blog` and `Post` is required, EF Core uses `INNER JOIN` when constructing the query:

```sql
SELECT [p].[PostId], [p].[BlogId], [p].[Content], [p].[IsDeleted], [p].[Title], [t].[BlogId], [t].[Name], [t].[Url]
FROM [Posts] AS [p]
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT [b].[BlogId], [b].[Name], [b].[Url]
    FROM [Blogs] AS [b]
    WHERE [b].[Url] LIKE N'%fish%'
) AS [t] ON [p].[BlogId] = [t].[BlogId]
```

Use of the `INNER JOIN` filters out all `Post`s whose related `Blog`s have been removed by a global query filter.

It can be addressed by using optional navigation instead of required.
This way the first query stays the same as before, however the second query will now generate `LEFT JOIN` and return 6 results.

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../samples/core/Querying/QueryFilters/FilteredBloggingContextRequired.cs#OptionalNavigation)]

Alternative approach is to specify consistent filters on both `Blog` and `Post` entities.
This way matching filters are applied to both `Blog` and `Post`. `Post`s that could end up in unexpected state are removed and both queries return 3 results.

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../samples/core/Querying/QueryFilters/FilteredBloggingContextRequired.cs#MatchingFilters)]

## Disabling Filters

Filters may be disabled for individual LINQ queries by using the <xref:Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.EntityFrameworkQueryableExtensions.IgnoreQueryFilters%2A> operator.

[!code-csharp[Main](../../../samples/core/Querying/QueryFilters/Program.cs#IgnoreFilters)]

## Limitations

Global query filters have the following limitations:

* Filters can only be defined for the root Entity Type of an inheritance hierarchy.
