# Using a Separate Migrations Project

You may want to store your migrations in a different project than the one containing your `DbContext`. You can also use this strategy to maintain multiple sets of migrations, for example, one for development and another for release-to-release upgrades.

> [!TIP]
> You can view this article's [sample on GitHub](https://github.com/dotnet/EntityFramework.Docs/tree/main/samples/core/Schemas/ThreeProjectMigrations).

## Steps

1. Create a new class library.

2. Add a reference to your DbContext project.

3. Move the migrations and model snapshot files to the class library.
   > [!TIP]
   > If you have no existing migrations, generate one in the project containing the DbContext then move it.
   > This is important because if the migrations project does not contain an existing migration, the Add-Migration command will be unable to find the DbContext.

4. Configure the migrations assembly:

   [!code-csharp[](../../../../samples/core/Schemas/ThreeProjectMigrations/WebApplication1/Startup.cs#snippet_MigrationsAssembly)]

5. Add a reference to your migrations project from the **startup** project.

   ```xml
   <ItemGroup>
     <ProjectReference Include="..\WebApplication1.Migrations\WebApplication1.Migrations.csproj" />
   </ItemGroup>
   ```

   If this causes a circular dependency, you can update the base output path of the **migrations** project instead:

   ```xml
   <PropertyGroup>
     <BaseOutputPath>..\WebApplication1\bin\</BaseOutputPath>
   </PropertyGroup>
   ```

If you did everything correctly, you should be able to add new migrations to the project.

## [.NET Core CLI](#tab/dotnet-core-cli)

```dotnetcli
dotnet ef migrations add NewMigration --project WebApplication1.Migrations
```

## [Visual Studio](#tab/vs)

```powershell
Add-Migration NewMigration -Project WebApplication1.Migrations
```
