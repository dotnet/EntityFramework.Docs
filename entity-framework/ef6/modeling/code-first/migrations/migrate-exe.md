# Using migrate.exe
Code First Migrations can be used to update a database from inside visual studio, but can also be executed via the command line tool migrate.exe. This page will give a quick overview on how to use migrate.exe to execute migrations against a database.

> [!NOTE]
> This article assumes you know how to use Code First Migrations in basic scenarios. If you don’t, then you’ll need to read [Code First Migrations](xref:ef6/modeling/code-first/migrations/index) before continuing.

## Copy migrate.exe

When you install Entity Framework using NuGet migrate.exe will be inside the tools folder of the downloaded package. In &lt;project folder&gt;\\packages\\EntityFramework.&lt;version&gt;\\tools

Once you have migrate.exe then you need to copy it to the location of the assembly that contains your migrations.

If your application targets .NET 4, and not 4.5, then you will need to copy the **Redirect.config** into the location as well and rename it **migrate.exe.config**. This is so that migrate.exe gets the correct binding redirects to be able to locate the Entity Framework assembly.

| .NET 4.5                                      | .NET 4.0                                      |
|:----------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------|
| ![.NET 4.5 Files](~/ef6/media/net45files.png) | ![.NET 4.0 Files](~/ef6/media/net40files.png) |

> [!NOTE]
> migrate.exe doesn't support x64 assemblies.

Once you have moved migrate.exe to the correct folder then you should be able to use it to execute migrations against the database. All the utility is designed to do is execute migrations. It cannot generate migrations or create a SQL script.

## See options

``` console
Migrate.exe /?
```

The above will display the help page associated with this utility, note that you will need to have the EntityFramework.dll in the same location that you are running migrate.exe in order for this to work.

## Migrate to the latest migration

``` console
Migrate.exe MyMvcApplication.dll /startupConfigurationFile="..\\web.config"
```

When running migrate.exe the only mandatory parameter is the assembly, which is the assembly that contains the migrations that you are trying to run, but it will use all convention based settings if you do not specify the configuration file.

## Migrate to a specific migration

``` console
Migrate.exe MyApp.exe /startupConfigurationFile="MyApp.exe.config" /targetMigration="AddTitle"
```

If you want to run migrations up to a specific migration, then you can specify the name of the migration. This will run all previous migrations as required until getting to the migration specified.

## Specify working directory

``` console
Migrate.exe MyApp.exe /startupConfigurationFile="MyApp.exe.config" /startupDirectory="c:\\MyApp"
```

If you assembly has dependencies or reads files relative to the working directory then you will need to set startupDirectory.

## Specify migration configuration to use

``` console
Migrate.exe MyAssembly CustomConfig /startupConfigurationFile="..\\web.config"
```

If you have multiple migration configuration classes, classes inheriting from DbMigrationConfiguration, then you need to specify which is to be used for this execution. This is specified by providing the optional second parameter without a switch as above.

## Provide connection string

``` console
Migrate.exe BlogDemo.dll /connectionString="Data Source=localhost;Initial Catalog=BlogDemo;Integrated Security=SSPI" /connectionProviderName="System.Data.SqlClient"
```

If you wish to specify a connection string at the command line then you must also provide the provider name. Not specifying the provider name will cause an exception.
