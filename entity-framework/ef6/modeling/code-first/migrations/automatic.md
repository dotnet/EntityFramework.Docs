# Automatic Code First Migrations
Automatic Migrations allows you to use Code First Migrations without having a code file in your project for each change you make. Not all changes can be applied automatically - for example column renames require the use of a code-based migration.

> [!NOTE]
> This article assumes you know how to use Code First Migrations in basic scenarios. If you don’t, then you’ll need to read [Code First Migrations](xref:ef6/modeling/code-first/migrations/index) before continuing.

## Recommendation for Team Environments

You can intersperse automatic and code-based migrations but this is not recommended in team development scenarios. If you are part of a team of developers that use source control you should either use purely automatic migrations or purely code-based migrations. Given the limitations of automatic migrations we recommend using code-based migrations in team environments.

## Building an Initial Model & Database

Before we start using migrations we need a project and a Code First model to work with. For this walkthrough we are going to use the canonical **Blog** and **Post** model.

-   Create a new **MigrationsAutomaticDemo** Console application
-   Add the latest version of the **EntityFramework** NuGet package to the project
    -   **Tools –&gt; Library Package Manager –&gt; Package Manager Console**
    -   Run the **Install-Package EntityFramework** command
-   Add a **Model.cs** file with the code shown below. This code defines a single **Blog** class that makes up our domain model and a **BlogContext** class that is our EF Code First context

  ``` csharp
      using System.Data.Entity;
      using System.Collections.Generic;
      using System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations;
      using System.Data.Entity.Infrastructure;

      namespace MigrationsAutomaticDemo
      {
          public class BlogContext : DbContext
          {
              public DbSet<Blog> Blogs { get; set; }
          }

          public class Blog
          {
              public int BlogId { get; set; }
              public string Name { get; set; }
          }
      }
  ```

-   Now that we have a model it’s time to use it to perform data access. Update the **Program.cs** file with the code shown below.

  ``` csharp
      using System;
      using System.Collections.Generic;
      using System.Linq;
      using System.Text;

      namespace MigrationsAutomaticDemo
      {
          class Program
          {
              static void Main(string[] args)
              {
                  using (var db = new BlogContext())
                  {
                      db.Blogs.Add(new Blog { Name = "Another Blog " });
                      db.SaveChanges();

                      foreach (var blog in db.Blogs)
                      {
                          Console.WriteLine(blog.Name);
                      }
                  }

                  Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit...");
                  Console.ReadKey();
              }
          }
      }
  ```

-   Run your application and you will see that a **MigrationsAutomaticCodeDemo.BlogContext** database is created for you.

## Enabling Migrations

It’s time to make some more changes to our model.

-   Let’s introduce a Url property to the Blog class.

``` csharp
    public string Url { get; set; }
```

If you were to run the application again you would get an InvalidOperationException stating *The model backing the 'BlogContext' context has changed since the database was created. Consider using Code First Migrations to update the database (* [*http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=238269*](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=238269)*).*

As the exception suggests, it’s time to start using Code First Migrations. Because we want to use automatic migrations we’re going to specify the **–EnableAutomaticMigrations** switch.

-   Run the **Enable-Migrations –EnableAutomaticMigrations** command in Package Manager Console
    This command has added a **Migrations** folder to our project. This new folder contains one file:

-   **The Configuration class.** This class allows you to configure how Migrations behaves for your context. For this walkthrough we will just use the default configuration.
    *Because there is just a single Code First context in your project, Enable-Migrations has automatically filled in the context type this configuration applies to.*

 

## Your First Automatic Migration

Code First Migrations has two primary commands that you are going to become familiar with.

-   **Add-Migration** will scaffold the next migration based on changes you have made to your model since the last migration was created
-   **Update-Database** will apply any pending migrations to the database

We are going to avoid using Add-Migration (unless we really need to) and focus on letting Code First Migrations automatically calculate and apply the changes. Let’s use **Update-Database** to get Code First Migrations to push the changes to our model (the new **Blog.Ur**l property) to the database.

-   Run the **Update-Database** command in Package Manager Console.

The **MigrationsAutomaticDemo.BlogContext** database is now updated to include the **Url** column in the **Blogs** table.

 

## Your Second Automatic Migration

Let’s make another change and let Code First Migrations automatically push the changes to the database for us.

-   Let's also add a new **Post** class

``` csharp
    public class Post
    {
        public int PostId { get; set; }
        [MaxLength(200)]
        public string Title { get; set; }
        public string Content { get; set; }

        public int BlogId { get; set; }
        public Blog Blog { get; set; }
    }
```

-   We'll also add a **Posts** collection to the **Blog** class to form the other end of the relationship between **Blog** and **Post**

``` csharp
    public virtual List<Post> Posts { get; set; }
```

Now use **Update-Database** to bring the database up-to-date. This time let’s specify the **–Verbose** flag so that you can see the SQL that Code First Migrations is running.

-   Run the **Update-Database –Verbose** command in Package Manager Console.

## Adding a Code Based Migration

Now let’s look at something we might want to use a code-based migration for.

-   Let’s add a **Rating** property to the **Blog** class

``` csharp
    public int Rating { get; set; }
```

We could just run **Update-Database** to push these changes to the database. However, we're adding a non-nullable **Blogs.Rating** column, if there is any existing data in the table it will get assigned the CLR default of the data type for new column (Rating is integer, so that would be **0**). But we want to specify a default value of **3** so that existing rows in the **Blogs** table will start with a decent rating.
Let’s use the Add-Migration command to write this change out to a code-based migration so that we can edit it. The **Add-Migration** command allows us to give these migrations a name, let’s just call ours **AddBlogRating**.

-   Run the **Add-Migration AddBlogRating** command in Package Manager Console.
-   In the **Migrations** folder we now have a new **AddBlogRating** migration. The migration filename is pre-fixed with a timestamp to help with ordering. Let’s edit the generated code to specify a default value of 3 for Blog.Rating (Line 10 in the code below)

*The migration also has a code-behind file that captures some metadata. This metadata will allow Code First Migrations to replicate the automatic migrations we performed before this code-based migration. This is important if another developer wants to run our migrations or when it’s time to deploy our application.*

``` csharp
    namespace MigrationsAutomaticDemo.Migrations
    {
        using System;
        using System.Data.Entity.Migrations;

        public partial class AddBlogRating : DbMigration
        {
            public override void Up()
            {
                AddColumn("Blogs", "Rating", c => c.Int(nullable: false, defaultValue: 3));
            }

            public override void Down()
            {
                DropColumn("Blogs", "Rating");
            }
        }
    }
```

Our edited migration is looking good, so let’s use **Update-Database** to bring the database up-to-date.

-   Run the **Update-Database** command in Package Manager Console.

## Back to Automatic Migrations

We are now free to switch back to automatic migrations for our simpler changes. Code First Migrations will take care of performing the automatic and code-based migrations in the correct order based on the metadata it is storing in the code-behind file for each code-based migration.

-   Let’s add a Post.Abstract property to our model

``` csharp
    public string Abstract { get; set; }
```

Now we can use **Update-Database** to get Code First Migrations to push this change to the database using an automatic migration.

-   Run the **Update-Database** command in Package Manager Console.

## Summary

In this walkthrough you saw how to use automatic migrations to push model changes to the database. You also saw how to scaffold and run code-based migrations in between automatic migrations when you need more control.
