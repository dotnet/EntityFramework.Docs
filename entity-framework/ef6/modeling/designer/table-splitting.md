# Designer Table Splitting
This walkthrough shows how to map multiple entity types to a single table by modifying a model with the Entity Framework Designer (EF Designer).

One reason you may want to use table splitting is delaying the loading of some properties when using lazy loading to load your objects. You can separate the properties that might contain very large amount of data into a separate entity and only load it when required.

The following image shows the main windows that are used when working with the EF Designer.

## Prerequisites

To complete this walkthrough, you will need:

- A recent version of Visual Studio.
- The [School sample database](xref:ef6/resources/school-database).

## Set up the Project

This walkthrough is using Visual Studio 2012.

-   Open Visual Studio 2012.
-   On the **File** menu, point to **New**, and then click **Project**.
-   In the left pane, click Visual C\#, and then select the Console Application template.
-   Enter **TableSplittingSample** as the name of the project and click **OK**.

## Create a Model based on the School Database

-   Right-click the project name in Solution Explorer, point to **Add**, and then click **New Item**.
-   Select **Data** from the left menu and then select **ADO.NET Entity Data Model** in the Templates pane.
-   Enter **TableSplittingModel.edmx** for the file name, and then click **Add**.
-   In the Choose Model Contents dialog box, select **Generate from database**, and then click **Next.**
-   Click New Connection. In the Connection Properties dialog box, enter the server name (for example, **(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb**), select the authentication method, type **School** for the database name, and then click **OK**.
    The Choose Your Data Connection dialog box is updated with your database connection setting.
-   In the Choose Your Database Objects dialog box, unfold the **Tables** node and check the **Person** table. This will add the specified table to the **School** model.
-   Click **Finish**.

The Entity Designer, which provides a design surface for editing your model, is displayed. All the objects that you selected in the **Choose Your Database Objects** dialog box are added to the model.

## Map Two Entities to a Single Table

In this section you will split the **Person** entity into two entities and then map them to a single table.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Person** entity does not contain any properties that may contain large amount of data; it is just used as an example.

-   Right-click an empty area of the design surface, point to **Add New**, and click **Entity**.
    The **New Entity** dialog box appears.
-   Type **HireInfo** for the **Entity name** and **PersonID** for the **Key Property** name.
-   Click **OK**.
-   A new entity type is created and displayed on the design surface.
-   Select the **HireDate** property of the **Person** entity type and press **Ctrl+X** keys.
-   Select the **HireInfo** entity and press **Ctrl+V** keys.
-   Create an association between **Person** and **HireInfo**. To do this, right-click an empty area of the design surface, point to **Add New**, and click **Association**.
-   The **Add Association** dialog box appears. The **PersonHireInfo** name is given by default.
-   Specify multiplicity **1(One)** on both ends of the relationship.
-   Press **OK**.

The next step requires the **Mapping Details** window. If you cannot see this window, right-click the design surface and select **Mapping Details**.

-   Select the **HireInfo** entity type and click **&lt;Add a Table or View&gt;** in the **Mapping Details** window.
-   Select **Person** from the **&lt;Add a Table or View&gt;** field drop-down list. The list contains tables or views to which the selected entity can be mapped.
    The appropriate properties should be mapped by default.

    ![Mapping Properties](~/ef6/media/mapping.png)

-   Select the **PersonHireInfo** association on the design surface.
-   Right-click the association on the design surface and select **Properties**.
-   In the **Properties** window, select the **Referential Constraints** property and click the ellipses button.
-   Select **Person** from the **Principal** drop-down list.
-   Press **OK**.

 

## Use the Model

-   Paste the following code in the Main method.

``` csharp
    using (var context = new SchoolEntities())
    {
        Person person = new Person()
        {
            FirstName = "Kimberly",
            LastName = "Morgan",
            Discriminator = "Instructor",
        };

        person.HireInfo = new HireInfo()
        {
            HireDate = DateTime.Now
        };

        // Add the new person to the context.
        context.People.Add(person);

        // Insert a row into the Person table.  
        context.SaveChanges();

        // Execute a query against the Person table.
        // The query returns columns that map to the Person entity.
        var existingPerson = context.People.FirstOrDefault();

        // Execute a query against the Person table.
        // The query returns columns that map to the Instructor entity.
        var hireInfo = existingPerson.HireInfo;

        Console.WriteLine("{0} was hired on {1}",
            existingPerson.LastName, hireInfo.HireDate);
    }
```
-   Compile and run the application.

The following T-SQL statements were executed against the **School** database as a result of running this application. 

-   The following **INSERT** was executed as a result of executing context.SaveChanges() and combines data from the **Person** and **HireInfo** entities

    ![Insert Combining Person and HireInfo Data](~/ef6/media/insert.png)

-   The following **SELECT** was executed as a result of executing context.People.FirstOrDefault() and selects just the columns mapped to **Person**

    ![Select 1](~/ef6/media/select1.png)

-   The following **SELECT** was executed as a result of accessing the navigation property existingPerson.Instructor and selects just the columns mapped to **HireInfo**
