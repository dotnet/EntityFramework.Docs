# Code-based configuration
> [!NOTE]
> **EF6 Onwards Only** - The features, APIs, etc. discussed in this page were introduced in Entity Framework 6. If you are using an earlier version, some or all of the information does not apply.  

Configuration for an Entity Framework application can be specified in a config file (app.config/web.config) or through code. The latter is known as code-based configuration.  

Configuration in a config file is described in a [separate article](xref:ef6/fundamentals/configuring/config-file). The config file takes precedence over code-based configuration. In other words, if a configuration option is set in both code and in the config file, then the setting in the config file is used.  

## Using `DbConfiguration`

Code-based configuration in EF6 and above is achieved by creating a subclass of `System.Data.Entity.Config.DbConfiguration`. The following guidelines should be followed when subclassing `DbConfiguration`:  

- Create only one `DbConfiguration` class for your application. This class specifies app-domain wide settings.  
- Place your `DbConfiguration` class in the same assembly as your `DbContext` class. (See the *Moving `DbConfiguration`* section if you want to change this.)  
- Give your `DbConfiguration` class a public parameterless constructor.  
- Set configuration options by calling protected `DbConfiguration` methods from within this constructor.  

Following these guidelines allows EF to discover and use your configuration automatically by both tooling that needs to access your model and when your application is run.  

## Example  

A class derived from `DbConfiguration` might look like this:  

``` csharp
using System.Data.Entity;
using System.Data.Entity.Infrastructure;
using System.Data.Entity.SqlServer;

namespace MyNamespace
{
    public class MyConfiguration : DbConfiguration
    {
        public MyConfiguration()
        {
            SetExecutionStrategy("System.Data.SqlClient", () => new SqlAzureExecutionStrategy());
            SetDefaultConnectionFactory(new LocalDbConnectionFactory("mssqllocaldb"));
        }
    }
}
```  

This class sets up EF to use the SQL Azure execution strategy - to automatically retry failed database operations - and to use Local DB for databases that are created by convention from Code First.  

## Moving `DbConfiguration`  

There are cases where it is not possible to place your `DbConfiguration` class in the same assembly as your `DbContext` class. For example, you may have two `DbContext` classes each in different assemblies. There are two options for handling this.  

The first option is to use the config file to specify the `DbConfiguration` instance to use. To do this, set the codeConfigurationType attribute of the entityFramework section. For example:  

``` xml
<entityFramework codeConfigurationType="MyNamespace.MyDbConfiguration, MyAssembly">
    ...Your EF config...
</entityFramework>
```  

The value of codeConfigurationType must be the assembly and namespace qualified name of your `DbConfiguration` class.  

The second option is to place `DbConfigurationTypeAttribute` on your context class. For example:  

``` csharp  
[DbConfigurationType(typeof(MyDbConfiguration))]
public class MyContextContext : DbContext
{
}
```  

The value passed to the attribute can either be your `DbConfiguration` type - as shown above - or the assembly and namespace qualified type name string. For example:  

``` csharp
[DbConfigurationType("MyNamespace.MyDbConfiguration, MyAssembly")]
public class MyContextContext : DbContext
{
}
```  

## Setting `DbConfiguration` explicitly  

There are some situations where configuration may be needed before any `DbContext` type has been used. Examples of this include:  

- Using `DbModelBuilder` to build a model without a context  
- Using some other framework/utility code that utilizes a `DbContext` where that context is used before your application context is used  

In such situations EF is unable to discover the configuration automatically and you must instead do one of the following:  

- Set the `DbConfiguration` type in the config file, as described in the *Moving `DbConfiguration`* section above
- Call the static `DbConfiguration`.SetConfiguration method during application startup  

## Overriding `DbConfiguration`  

There are some situations where you need to override the configuration set in the `DbConfiguration`. This is not typically done by application developers but rather by third party providers and plug-ins that cannot use a derived `DbConfiguration` class.  

For this, EntityFramework allows an event handler to be registered that can modify existing configuration just before it is locked down.  It also provides a sugar method specifically for replacing any service returned by the EF service locator. This is how it is intended to be used:  

- At app startup (before EF is used) the plug-in or provider should register the event handler method for this event. (Note that this must happen before the application uses EF.)  
- The event handler makes a call to ReplaceService for every service that needs to be replaced.  

For example, to replace `IDbConnectionFactory` and `DbProviderService` you would register a handler something like this:  

``` csharp
DbConfiguration.Loaded += (_, a) =>
   {
       a.ReplaceService<DbProviderServices>((s, k) => new MyProviderServices(s));
       a.ReplaceService<IDbConnectionFactory>((s, k) => new MyConnectionFactory(s));
   };
```  

In the code above, `MyProviderServices` and `MyConnectionFactory` represent your implementations of the service.  

You can also add additional dependency handlers to get the same effect.  

Note that you could also wrap `DbProviderFactory` in this way, but doing so will only affect EF and not uses of the `DbProviderFactory` outside of EF. For this reason you’ll probably want to continue to wrap `DbProviderFactory` as you have before.  

You should also keep in mind the services that you run externally to your application - for example, when running migrations from the Package Manager Console. When you run migrate from the console it will attempt to find your `DbConfiguration`. However, whether or not it will get the wrapped service depends on where the event handler it registered. If it is registered as part of the construction of your `DbConfiguration` then the code should execute and the service should get wrapped. Usually this won’t be the case and this means that tooling won’t get the wrapped service.
