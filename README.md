# Entity Framework Docs

This project contains the source for EF Core and EF6 documentation published at [Entity Framework documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/ef/).

Documentation issues for both EF Core and EF6 should be filed in this repo. Product issues (bugs) should be filed in the [EF Core repo](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore) or the [EF6 repo](https://github.com/dotnet/ef6) as appropriate.

**We accept pull requests!**

## Fixing typos/spelling/grammar/etc

Consider sending a pull request rather than filing an issue. This can be done entirely from the web:

* From upper right corner of the document, select the pen icon:

  Note: You might need to make the browser window wider to see the pen icon.

* Click on the edit button (✏️) to edit in your web browser

* When done, add a title and description, then use the **Create a new branch and start a pull request.** option.

Note that you can also clone this repo and do a GitHub PR in the normal way.

## Making more substantial changes

Pull requests for more substantial changes are also encouraged. However, before submitting a pull request, please [read the CONTRIBUTING guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md), which include information on how to build the docs locally, as well as style and organizational guidance.
